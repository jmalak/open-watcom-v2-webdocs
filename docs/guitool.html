<H1 ID="Open_Watcom_Integrated_Development_Environment"> Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment </H1>
<BR>Software development normally involves managing a number of different files for each project.&nbsp; A project often includes
multiple source files, include files, and libraries.&nbsp; In addition, there are usually several programming tools involved:
&nbsp;compilers, linkers, preprocessors, debuggers, editors, and so on.&nbsp; But this is likely not new to you.&nbsp; What
will be new is the Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
<BR><BR>The Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment is a software development tool that manages project files and language
tools.&nbsp; Although it is really a tool itself, the common term to describe it (and possibly the best analogy) is<B> Development
Environment.</B>&nbsp; By using the Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment, you have direct access to each of the
files relating to a project and all of the language tools you require to build your application.
<BR><BR><IMG SRC="ide_s.bmp" ALIGN=MIDDLE>
<H2 ID="How_the_Environment_Operates"> How the Environment Operates </H2>
<BR>The Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment has a graphical interface that combines file management and tool management.
&nbsp;An IDE session deals with a<B> Project.</B>&nbsp; A project can be generally defined as the collection of files and
necessary information that relates to the development of project components.&nbsp; However, a project is more than just a
graphical representation of a file list-it contains all of the underlying smarts to understand the interrelation of all files
associated with the project and to ensure that these files are up-to-date.
<BR><BR>Each project component is referred to as a<B> Target.</B>&nbsp; An Integrated Development Environment target is made
up of the source files, include files, libraries, and MAKE instructions to create the target file (for example, &quot;.exe&quot;,
&quot;.dll&quot;, &quot;.lib&quot;, or &quot;.hlp&quot;).&nbsp; A project often has more than one target.&nbsp; Each target
can be set to create the associated target file for a specific destination platform.
<BR><BR>Within a target, there are<B> Sources.</B>&nbsp; A source is an individual file (such as a &quot;.c&quot; or &quot;.cpp&quot;
file, but it can also be a &quot;.bmp&quot;, &quot;.rc&quot;, or &quot;.lib&quot; file) used to create the target file.&nbsp;
A target usually has more than one source.
<H2 ID="How_the_Integrated_Development_Environment_Looks"> How the Integrated Development Environment Looks </H2>
<BR>In the following illustration, the main window is the project window for a project entitled<TT> first.wpj.</TT>&nbsp;
The sub-window represents the target for this project,<TT> target1.exe.</TT>&nbsp; The source file for the target is listed
within the target window.&nbsp; In this project, there is only a single target with a single source file.
<BR><BR><TT><IMG SRC="ide1.bmp" ALIGN=MIDDLE></TT>
<BR><B><I>Figure 1.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> The Open Watcom IDE window displays project and target windows.</B>
<BR><BR>The language tools are available on the toolbar and the drop-down menus.&nbsp; For example, on the Sources menu, you
can work with the source that is selected in the target window.&nbsp; Here you can add a new source, remove or rename an existing
source, edit a source, and so on.&nbsp; A similar set of target actions are available in the Targets menu and project actions
are located in the File menu.
<BR><BR>A single IDE session displays a project.&nbsp; If the project consists of a number of components, such as two executables
and one library, these appear as target sub-windows on the project window.&nbsp; Each target window displays the files necessary
to construct the target and associates files with a rule describing the construction mechanism based on filename extension.
&nbsp;For example, a filename with the extension &quot;.exe&quot; may associate with the rule for constructing executables,
or a filename with the extension &quot;.lib&quot; may associate with the rule for constructing static libraries.
<BR><BR>Different projects can refer to the same target.&nbsp; If they do, either project can manipulate the shared target
and any changes to either project affect the shared target.
<H2 ID="The_Files_the_Integrated_Development_Environment_Uses"> The Files the Integrated Development Environment Uses </H2>
<BR>The Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment creates and manages a project, referencing a number of targets.&nbsp;
The IDE uses filename extensions to represent projects and targets.&nbsp; The extension &quot;.wpj&quot; represents projects
and the extension &quot;.tgt&quot; represents targets.&nbsp; The IDE compiles and links the target in the target directory.
<BR><BR>The project file (.wpj) contains the names of all of the target files related to the project, including housekeeping
information about the project and the current IDE session.
<BR><BR>Each target file (.tgt) describes one target and includes the name and type of the target executable, a reference
to a rule describing how to build the target, and a list of relevant switches the rule uses.&nbsp; In addition, target files
also contain the names of all of the source files used to construct the target program, references to similar rules for compiling
them, and relevant switches.
<BR><BR>In constructing targets, the Integrated Development Environment references a list of rules defined in a configuration
file, called<TT> ide.cfg.</TT>&nbsp; Each rule defines a command line used to do the construction and a list of actions you
can perform on the target program (such as make, run, or debug) or on the files in the item list (such as make or edit).&nbsp;
Additionally, rules refer to tools.
<BR><BR>Tools define which command line switches you can use in the Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment.

<H2 ID="Getting_Started_with_a_Short_Tutorial"> Getting Started with a Short Tutorial </H2>
<BR>Perhaps the easiest way to understand how the Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment manages an entire project's
files and tools, is to work through a brief example.&nbsp; In this walk-through, you create and execute a simple C program
using the IDE.&nbsp; FORTRAN developers can follow along substituting FORTRAN code and file names where appropriate.&nbsp;
The session will help you understand the basic concepts of the IDE and the steps involved in project development.
<BR><BR>The illustrations shown in this section are taken from the Windows environment.&nbsp; The OS/2 environment is very
similar with some minor differences.&nbsp; For example, in the OS/2 environment the IDE uses the OS/2 Editor rather than Open
Watcom's Windows Editor.&nbsp; Although this tutorial builds a Win32 executable, you can choose to build a Win16 or OS/2 PM
executable.&nbsp; The procedures to follow are not that much different.&nbsp; When the time comes to select the type of target,
simply choose an environment that you can run on your machine so that you can run your application to make sure it works.

<BR><BR>For the OS/2 IDE, you can add multiple source files to the target at one time by inserting a space between each filename
you enter.&nbsp; You can also use the file browser to add files by clicking on the Browse...&nbsp; button.
<BR><BR>For all other systems, you can enter the names of the source files (with extensions) in the File Name field or you
can use the file browser to select files.&nbsp; The type of files displayed in file list window can be controlled by modifying
the List Files of Type field.&nbsp; Once you have typed a name in the File Name field or selected a name from the file list,
you can add it to the list of source files to be included by clicking the Add button.&nbsp; All files in the file list can
be added by clicking the Add All button.&nbsp; Individual names can be removed from the &quot;add&quot; list by selecting
them and clicking the Remove button.

<BR><BR>The IDE adds the new source files to the target window, followed by the characters [n/a].&nbsp; This indicates that
the source files are not available, meaning that the files do not yet exist.&nbsp; The indicators are:
<DL>
<DT>[n/a]
<DD>This code appears if the file does not exist.
<DT>[r/o]
<DD>This code appears if the file is Read Only.
<DT>[sw]
<DD>This code appears if the user has set switches for the specified source file.
</DL>
<BR>The Integrated Development Environment organizes the source files in the target window under headers according to the
filename extension.&nbsp; You can expand and collapse the file groups by clicking on the folder icon.
<BR><BR>For this tutorial, we only need one source file, so now we will delete the extra files from the target.
<DT>(7)

<BR><BR>You can now save your work and close the Editor in one of the following two ways:&nbsp; close down the entire editor
or close down only the source file window.&nbsp; For this exercise, close only the source file window as follows.
<DT>(11)
<DD><B> Choose Close</B> from the File menu to close down the current source file window.
<BR><BR>In both cases, if changes have been made to the file and not saved, a message prompts you to save the changes before
exiting.&nbsp; The advantage of closing only the Editor window is that the Editor continues to run.&nbsp; If you need to access
it again, you will not need to wait for it to go through the start-up procedures again.
<DL>
<DT>Important:
<DD>You must save the file.&nbsp; The Open Watcom compilers do not access the source lines in the Editor's buffers.

<BR><BR>The program you wrote is a character mode application and its output appears in a separate console window.&nbsp; You
are now ready to debug your target program.&nbsp; You probably do not need to debug this simple program with the Open Watcom
Debugger but go through the steps so that you know what to do for more complex programs.
<BR><BR>The IDE has several debugging information options which it uses as defaults when it is started.&nbsp; The first thing
to do is check to make sure that your application compiled with the default debugging information activated.
<DT>(22)
<DD><B> Choose Target Options</B> from the Targets menu to activate the Target Options menu.
<BR><BR>The option Use Development Switches should appear in grey text with a check mark next to it.&nbsp; Development Switches
automatically include debugging information in the target.&nbsp; If you were to select Use Release Switches, the IDE would
select options useful for a production version of your program.&nbsp; Selecting this option turns the text grey and places
a check mark beside it.&nbsp; The IDE uses the development switches by default.
<DL>
<DT>Note:
<DD>For the purpose of this session, you should make the target with the development switches on.&nbsp; If this is not the option
selected, select it and remake the target before debugging.

<H3 ID="Review_of_What_Happened"> Review of What Happened </H3>
<BR>In this session, you created a project called<TT> first.wpj.</TT>&nbsp; This project had one target called<TT> target1.exe,</TT>
a 32-bit Windows executable (unless you specified another target type).&nbsp; Using the Open Watcom Editor, you entered and
edited the source text in a file called<TT> source1.c</TT> or<TT> source1.for</TT> (if you tried the FORTRAN example).&nbsp;
You compiled and linked it into an executable program using the Open Watcom Make utility, a Open Watcom compiler, and the
Open Watcom Linker.&nbsp; You ran it directly and under the control of the Open Watcom Debugger.
<BR><BR>When you saved the project, the Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment created the following permanent files:

target, it may or may not be able to share the same directory as other pre-existing targets.&nbsp; Generally, if the target
shares one or more of the same source files as other targets in the project, then it must be placed in its own subdirectory.
&nbsp;The object files that are produced for the target may have different attributes than a pre-existing target's object
files (e.g., 16-bit vs 32-bit).&nbsp; This is why the target should be placed in a separate subdirectory.

<H3 ID="Marking_a_Target_for_Remake"> Marking a Target for Remake </H3>
<BR>Marking a target for remake ensures that the IDE will perform the link the next time you make that target or make all
targets.&nbsp; This function is necessary if you are not using the Autodepend function in the Setup Target submenu under the
Targets menu.&nbsp; By marking a target for remake, you control when and which targets need to be remade.
<DL>
<DT>To mark a target for remake:
<DD>

<DT>(3)
<DD><B> Choose Yes or No</B> to continue.
<BR><BR>Choosing Yes marks all of the source files for the selected target as well as the target itself.&nbsp; This means
that the next time you do a make, the source files for the selected target will be compiled.&nbsp; Choosing No marks only
the selected target for remake.&nbsp; In both cases, the message box closes and you return to the Open Watcom IDE Project
window.
</DL>
<H3 ID="Making_Targets"> Making Targets </H3>
<BR>The Make function in the Targets menu creates an executable for the selected target.&nbsp; When you perform this function,
the IDE compiles the source files for the selected target into object files.&nbsp; The object files are then linked together
to create the target file.
<BR><BR>There are two make functions available to you for targets:&nbsp; Make and Make All.&nbsp; The Make All function in
the Actions menu tells the IDE to compile and link all of the targets for the current project.&nbsp; This can be a lengthy
process, depending upon the number of targets in your project, so you may choose to only make targets to which changes have
been made.&nbsp; This enables you to see if they can be made successfully.

<H2 ID="Working_with_Source_Files"> Working with Source Files </H2>
<BR>Once your project has a target you need to add source files to the target.&nbsp; The procedure for adding a source file
to a target is simple.&nbsp; Once you have source files that make up your target, you can also change the name of a source
file and remove source files.&nbsp; This section discusses the following topics:
<UL>
<LI>Adding Source Files
<LI>Removing Source Files
<LI>Renaming a Source File
<LI>Marking a Source File for Remake
<LI>Making Source Files
<LI>Viewing Included Files
</UL>
<H3 ID="Adding_Source_Files"> Adding Source Files </H3>
<BR>You add source files to the selected target (the target whose title bar is currently highlighted) using the Add File(s)
dialog.&nbsp; The current project must have a target in order to use the New Source function.&nbsp; You have two options when
adding source files to a target:&nbsp; you can either enter the name of a new source file or you can choose an existing source
file.&nbsp; When adding existing source files you can use the file browser, type sources one at a time into the Add File(s)
dialog, or use wild cards in the Add File(s) dialog.&nbsp; This section describes all methods for adding source files.
<BR><BR>The extension you use with the source file name determines the compiler that the IDE uses to create the target.&nbsp;
For example, the &quot;.c&quot; extension, invokes the Open Watcom C compiler to make the target.&nbsp; You can specify several
different compilers:
<DL>
<DT>xxx.asm
<DD>The &quot;.asm&quot; extension invokes the Open Watcom Assembler.
<DT>xxx.c
<DD>The &quot;.c&quot; extension invokes the Open Watcom C compiler.
<DT>xxx.cpp
<DD>The &quot;.cpp&quot; extension invokes the Open Watcom C++ compiler.
<DT>xxx.for
<DD>The &quot;.for&quot; extension invokes the Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 compiler.
<DT>xxx.hlp
<DD>The &quot;.hlp&quot; extension invokes either the Win16, OS/2, or Win32 compiler.
<DT>xxx.rc
<DD>The &quot;.rc&quot; extension invokes the Open Watcom resource compiler.
<DT>xxx.res
<DD>The &quot;.res&quot; extension invokes the Open Watcom Resource Editor.
<DT>xxx.sqc
<DD>The &quot;.sqc&quot; extension invokes the embedded SQL preprocessor and the Open Watcom C compiler.
<DT>xxx.sqp
<DD>The &quot;.sqp&quot; extension invokes the embedded SQL preprocessor and the Open Watcom C++ compiler.

<H2 ID="The_IDE_Switches"> The IDE Switches </H2>
<BR>There are a number of different switches you can set in the Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment.&nbsp; Switches
enables you to change the way the various tools, such as compilers and linkers, perform their jobs.&nbsp; The switches discussed
in this section are:
<UL>
<LI>Release and Development Switches
<LI>Target and Source File Switches
<LI>The Autodepend Switch
</UL>
<BR>This section discusses the different switches available in the IDE and how you can use them.
<H3 ID="Using_Release_and_Development_Switches"> Using Release and Development Switches </H3>
<BR>There are two sets of switches the IDE can use during the make process:&nbsp; Development and Release switches.&nbsp;
You are able to specify different switches in each set for each target in your project.&nbsp; The letters D and R in the target
window to the left of the target type indicate which set of switches is being used.&nbsp; You choose the switches you want
the IDE to use from the Target Options submenu under the Targets menu.&nbsp; The selected set of switches has a check mark
beside it and appears in grey text.
<DL>
<DT>To change the selected set of switches for a target:

<H3 ID="Using_the_Autodepend_Switch"> Using the Autodepend Switch </H3>
<BR>The Use Autodepend switch in the Target Options submenu of the Targets menu keeps track of updated source files.&nbsp;
Once a source is modified, the IDE remembers that it needs to be recompiled the next time you do a make.&nbsp; By using the
Use Autodepend switch, the IDE also keeps track of changes made to source files on which other source files depend.
<BR><BR>For example, let's say that your current project has a source file,<TT> source.cpp,</TT> that depends on a header
file,<TT> source.hpp.</TT>&nbsp; If the Use Autodepend feature is not enabled and changes are made to<TT> source.hpp</TT>
after<TT> source.cpp</TT> in your current project has been compiled, the IDE does not recognize that your current source file
is now out of date.&nbsp; This means that the next time you do a make, the IDE will not compile<TT> source.cpp.</TT>&nbsp;
The Use Autodepend feature tells the IDE to compare the date and time stamps on all of the dependent source files in addition
to the source files in the current project and their corresponding object files, so the IDE recognizes when your current source
file needs to be recompiled.
<DL>
<DT>To set the Use Autodepend switch:
<DD>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Choose Target Options</B> from the Targets menu.
<BR><BR>A submenu appears from the Target Options menu.&nbsp; A check mark beside the menu option indicates that it is enabled.
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Select the Use Autodepend option</B> from the Target Options submenu.
<BR><BR>If the option was enabled when you selected it, you have disabled the Use Autodepend feature.&nbsp; If the option
had no check mark when you selected it, you have enabled the Use Autodepend feature.

<H3 ID="Selecting_Your_Own_Text_Editor"> Selecting Your Own Text Editor </H3>
<BR>You can use your own favourite text editor from within the Integrated Development Environment.
<DL>
<DT>To select your own text editor:
<DD>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Choose Set Text Editor</B> from the File menu.
<BR><BR>The Set Text Editor dialog appears.&nbsp; You can enter the name of the text editor in the first field.&nbsp; You
must also indicate whether the text editor is an executable file or a Dynamic Link Library (DLL).&nbsp; If the editor is an
executable file (rather than a DLL), then you can enter an argument line in the second field.&nbsp; The argument line will
be supplied to the editor whenever it is started by the IDE.&nbsp; The argument line can include any of three different macros
which will be filled in by the IDE.&nbsp; The macros are:
<DL>
<DT>%f
<DD>The name of the file to be edited.
<DT>%r
<DD>The row in the file at which to position the cursor.&nbsp; If the editor is invoked from a diagnostic message which contains
a line number then the row value is extracted from the message; otherwise the row value is 1.
<DT>%c
<DD>The column in the file at which to position the cursor.&nbsp; If the editor is invoked from a diagnostic message which contains
a column number then the column value is extracted from the message; otherwise the column value is 1.
</DL>
<BR>For example, if the editor argument line that you specified was:
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file='%f' row='%r' col='%c'</TT>
<BR><BR>and you double click on an error message in the Log window that names the file<TT> foobar.c</TT> with an error at
line 215 and column 31, then the argument line that is passed to your editor is:
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file='foobar.c' row='215' col='31'</TT>
<BR><BR>This flexibility allows you to specify the name of the file to edit and the row and/or column at which to position
the text cursor.&nbsp; If no row or column is available, then the IDE will supply the value of 1 as a default.
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Select OK</B> when you wish to confirm the selection of a new editor.
<BR><BR>or
<DT>
<DD><B> Select Cancel</B> when you wish to cancel the selection of a new editor.

<H2 ID="Adding_Resources_to_a_Target"> Adding Resources to a Target </H2>
<BR>You may want to include resources in your target executable.&nbsp; There are two ways of doing this in the IDE:&nbsp;
indirectly and directly.&nbsp; The act of adding resources to a target can only be done for targets that support resources,
such as Windows or OS/2 PM.
<DL>
<DT>To add a resource to a target using the indirect method:
<DD>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Create a new source file</B> with the extension &quot;.rc&quot;.
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Click once on the new source file</B> to select it.
<DT>(3)
<DD><B> Choose Edit Text</B> from the Sources menu to invoke the Open Watcom Editor.

<BR><BR>The selected source file is highlighted in the target window.
<DT>(7)
<DD><B> Choose Make</B> from the Sources menu to compile the new source file.
<BR><BR>The IDE compiles the selected source file.&nbsp; To do this, the IDE invokes the Resource Compiler which creates a
&quot;.res&quot; file.&nbsp; The &quot;.res&quot; file will be automatically included in the target when it is linked.
</DL>
<BR>When you create the resource file directly, the source file contains the same information but it is stored in a different
format.
<DL>
<DT>To add a resource to a target using the direct method:
<DD>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Create a new source file</B> with the extension &quot;.res&quot;.
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Click once on the new source file</B> to select it.
<DT>(3)
<DD><B> Choose Edit Resources</B> from the Sources menu to invoke the Open Watcom Resource Editor.

<BR><BR>The selected source file is highlighted in the target window.
<DT>(7)
<DD><B> Choose Make</B> from the Sources menu to compile the new source file.
<BR><BR>The IDE compiles the selected source file.&nbsp; The IDE does not need to invoke the Resource Compiler to create a
&quot;.res&quot; file because you created the &quot;.res&quot; file directly using the Resource Editor.&nbsp; The &quot;.res&quot;
file will be automatically included in the target when it is linked.
</DL>
<H2 ID="Including_Libraries_in_a_Target"> Including Libraries in a Target </H2>
<BR>You use the same procedure to include static and DLL libraries in your target as you use to add any source file to a target.
&nbsp;The IDE includes the libraries when the target is linked.
<DL>
<DT>To create static and DLL libraries:
<DD>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Create a new target</B> entering the library name in the Target Name field and choosing the appropriate image type.
<BR><BR>Clicking on OK on the New Target dialog closes the dialog and creates a new target with the specified name in the
title bar.
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Add the desired source files,</B> new or existing, to the library you have created.
<DL>
<DT>Note:
<DD>If you want one of your other targets to use that library, you must enter the library as a source file for that target.&nbsp;
When you enter the library as a source file you must give it the extension &quot;.lib&quot;, regardless of whether the library
is a static or DLL library.&nbsp; For example, if your library is entitled Target A and you want your existing Target B to
use that library, add Target A as a source file on Target B with the extension &quot;.lib&quot;.

<H2 ID="Invoking_Other_Applications_from_the_IDE"> Invoking Other Applications from the IDE </H2>
<BR>When using the Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment, there are several other applications you may want to use.
&nbsp;To save you the frustration of having to constantly exit the IDE and start up a new application, we have made it possible
to invoke other applications from within the Integrated Development Environment.&nbsp; Following are the applications you
can invoke from the IDE:
<UL>
<LI>Browser
<LI>Open Watcom Debugger
<LI>Open Watcom Execution Sampler
<LI>Open Watcom Execution Profiler
<LI>Open Watcom Disassembler
<LI>Open Watcom Editor (text editor)
<LI>Open Watcom Resource Editor
<LI>Open Watcom Zoom
<LI>Open Watcom Heap Walker
<LI>Spy
<LI>DDE Spy
</UL>
<BR>You invoke these applications by making a selection from the toolbar or various menus in the IDE.&nbsp; The Actions menu
contains some of the applications.&nbsp; You can find others in the Targets and Sources menus.&nbsp; The menu options that
appear vary, depending on the contents of the current project.&nbsp; The applications are available in the menu items only
when appropriate.&nbsp; For example, if the currently selected target has no source files, no applications appear in the Sources
menu.
<BR><BR><B><I>Hint:</I></B>&nbsp; An alternate way to view the contents of the Targets and Sources menu is to click the right
mouse button while your cursor is positioned in the project window.&nbsp; If your cursor is positioned over a target, the
Targets menu appears.&nbsp; If your cursor is positioned over a source file, the Sources menu appears.
<BR><BR>Refer to the appropriate sections in this manual for detailed information on using the various applications.
<H2 ID="Invoking_DOS_Applications_from_the_IDE_under_OSD2"> Invoking DOS Applications from the IDE under OS/2 </H2>
<BR>There are occasions where you may wish to change the default DOS or WIN-OS/2 settings when running a DOS/Windows application
from the IDE.&nbsp; The mechanism which we provide is through the use of a special<B> IDE_DOS_SETTINGS</B> environment variable.
&nbsp;For example, to set the DPMI memory limit to 16 and to enable DOS BREAK, you can set the environment variable as follows:
<BR><BR><B>Example:</B>
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set ide_dos_settings=dpmi_memory_limit#16;dos_break#1</TT>
<BR><BR>Due to the command processor limitations, the &quot;#&quot; character is used in place of the &quot;=&quot;.&nbsp;
The above command is equivalent to configuring a DOS session with DOS settings as follows:
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Variable&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Value</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DPMI_MEMORY_LIMIT&nbsp;&nbsp; 16</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DOS_BREAK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ON</TT>
<H2 ID="Using_the_Information_of_the_IDE_from_outside"> Using the Information of the IDE from outside </H2>
<BR>The batch utility IDE2MAKE generates .mk and .mk1 makefiles for use with Open Watcom Make from the IDE .wpj and .tgt files.
&nbsp;See IDE2MAKE in Open Watcom Tools User's Guide.
<H1 ID="The_Open_Watcom_Browser"> The Open Watcom Browser </H1>
<BR><BR>Imagine being assigned to a project with thousands of lines of C++ source code.&nbsp; Learning the relationship between
the objects of such an application can be very difficult.&nbsp; The Browser was developed to solve this very problem - to
help developers better understand the source code they are working with.&nbsp; Information such as the class inheritance hierarchy
and the call tree for an application can be studied while using the Browser.&nbsp; Once you have located a symbol, you can
quickly view the source file that contains its definition or list all the files that reference it.&nbsp; Viewing these relationships
helps you understand how the program works.
<BR><BR>This chapter describes the many tasks you can perform with the Browser, including creating and opening a Browser database
file, configuring the Browser session, and viewing the list of all symbols in your program, the class inheritance hierarchy,
and call structure.
<H2 ID="Using_the_Browser"> Using the Browser </H2>
<BR>This section discusses the following topics:
<UL>
<LI>Starting the Browser
<LI>Starting the Browser through the Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment
<LI>Quitting the Browser
<LI>The Browser Menu Bar
</UL>
<H3 ID="Starting_the_Browser"> Starting the Browser </H3>
<BR>To start the Browser, double click on the Browser icon.&nbsp; This opens the Browser window.&nbsp; The caption bar of
this window displays the current option file and Browser database file.&nbsp; The message<TT> no browser file</TT> appears
on this line if a database file is not currently selected.
<BR><BR>The Browser is an integrated tool that you can open from the IDE so that you can browse the source code of the project
you are working on.&nbsp; Refer to the IDE guide for further information on the Integrated Development Environment.
<H3 ID="Quitting_the_Browser"> Quitting the Browser </H3>
<BR>To exit the Browser, choose<B> Exit</B> from the<B> File</B> menu of the Browser window.&nbsp; If you made changes to
the options during the Browser session, a message box appears prompting you to save the changes.
<BR><BR>Choose<B> No</B> in the message box to close the Browser session without saving.&nbsp; Any options changed within
the session are lost.
<BR><BR>Choose<B> Yes</B> in the message box to save the current options to the current option file, if one exists, and exit
the Browser session.&nbsp; If no option file exists, a<B> Save As</B> dialog appears that allows you to specify the option
file to which you want to save the new options.
<DL>
<DT>
<DD><B> Select</B><B> Cancel</B> to return to the main Browser window without saving the options.

<H3 ID="The_Browser_Menu_Bar"> The Browser Menu Bar </H3>
<BR>The Browser's menu bar consists of the following eight menus:
<DL>
<DT>File
<DD>Create, open, and configure Browser files; save and load options
<DT>View
<DD>Choose a global view for the current database file
<DT>Detail

</DL>
<H2 ID="Browser_Files"> Browser Files </H2>
<BR>To browse your source code, you must first create a Browser module file for each source file that you wish to browse.
&nbsp;Currently, browsing is supported by the Open Watcom C/C++ compilers only (Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 does not support browsing).
&nbsp;To create a Browser module file, specify the &quot;db&quot; option when you compile the source file.&nbsp; If you are
using the Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment, select<B> Emit Browser Information</B> from the<B> Debugging Switches</B>
panel of the<B> Compiler Switches</B> dialog.&nbsp; The Browser module file will have the same name as the source file and
an extension of &quot;.MBR&quot;.
<BR><BR>Once the Browser module files have been created, these files are merged and a Browser database file is created.&nbsp;
This process eliminates redundant information such as duplicate definitions that occur when a header file is included by many
source files.&nbsp; Browser database files have the extension &quot;.DBR&quot;.
<BR><BR>The Browser allows you to configure your session and saves this configuration to an options file.&nbsp; Options files
have the extension &quot;.OBR&quot;.&nbsp; The file name<TT> setup.obr</TT> is the default name of the options file.&nbsp;
The default options file is automatically loaded by the Browser when the Browser is started.

<H3 ID="Creating_a_Browser_Database_File_from_the_Command_Line"> Creating a Browser Database File from the Command Line </H3>
<BR>It is also possible to create the Browser database file from the command line.&nbsp; This allows you to make Browser database
file creation part of your standard build procedure.&nbsp; When you do this, the batch build procedure will automatically
update your database file.&nbsp; Updating the Browser database file occurs only if changes have been made to a module file
within the database file.
<BR><BR>A separate utility, called the merger, is used to create the database file.&nbsp; The name of the merger program is<TT>
wbrg.exe.</TT>&nbsp; Its command line consists of the name of the database file and a list of the module files (.MBR files)
to be merged.&nbsp; The name of the database file must be preceded by a<TT> database</TT> command.&nbsp; The default extension
given to the database file is &quot;.DBR&quot;.&nbsp; The list of module files must be preceded by a<TT> file</TT> command.
&nbsp;The module file names must be separated by commas or enclosed by curly braces and separated by spaces.&nbsp; The list
of module file names can contain wild cards.&nbsp; The following are examples of valid merger commands.&nbsp; In each case,
the module files<TT> m1.mbr</TT> and<TT> m2.mbr</TT> will be processed and the database file<TT> db.dbr</TT> will be created.
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wbrg database db file m1, m2</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wbrg database db file { m1 m2 }</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wbrg file m1, m2 database db</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wbrg file { m1 m2 } database db</TT>
<BR><BR>It is also possible to specify a command file that contains merger commands.&nbsp; Command files have the extension
&quot;.CBR&quot;.&nbsp; Consider a command file, called<TT> merge.cbr,</TT> containing the following merger commands.
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; database db</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file m1</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file m2</TT>
<BR><BR>The following example will achieve the same results as the previous example.
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wbrg @merge</TT>
<BR><BR>If you want to suppress the listing of file names that the merger produces as it is working, you can include the &quot;quiet&quot;
option on the command line or in the command file.

<H3 ID="Working_with_Browser_Module_Files"> Working with Browser Module Files </H3>
<BR>Once a Browser database file is loaded, you might want to edit the list of modules originally used to create the database
file.&nbsp; Editing the list of modules allows you to temporarily remove modules from the database or add modules to the database.
&nbsp;For example, you may decide that you only want to browse a particular module or set of modules or you may have forgotten
a module when the database was originally created.

symbol is used and where it is defined.
<BR><BR>To view a list of all symbols in the current Browser database file, choose<B> List</B> from the<B> View</B> menu.
&nbsp;This displays a window which can list all symbols in your program.&nbsp; The window has a vertical scroll bar that allows
you to scroll through the list of symbols in your program.&nbsp; Since your program may contain a very large number of symbols,
the Browser does not load all the symbols in your program from the database.&nbsp; Instead, only the number of symbols that
can be displayed in the window are loaded.&nbsp; As far as the Browser is concerned, this list is infinite.&nbsp; For this
reason, the scroll thumb on the vertical scroll bar is positioned in the middle of the vertical scroll bar and cannot be moved.
&nbsp;Click below the vertical scroll thumb to view the next page of symbols and above the vertical scroll thumb to view the
previous page of symbols.

<BR><B><I>Figure 33.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> The List window displays all symbols in the current browser database file.</B>
<BR><BR>Each symbol has a icon to its left.&nbsp; A letter marking each icon indicates the symbol type in the source code
as follows:
<DL>
<DT>F
<DD>Function
<DT>C
<DD>Class
<DT>T
<DD>Typedef
<DT>V
<DD>Variable
<DT>E
<DD>Enum
</DL>
<BR>There are several ways to display the detail view of symbols.&nbsp; When you reveal the detail view, the file folder icon
changes to an open file folder.&nbsp; To close the detail view dialog, click on the file folder.&nbsp; This changes the icon
back to a closed folder and closes the dialog.&nbsp; To reveal the detail view of a symbol you can perform any of the following
actions:
<UL>
<LI>The file folder icons are hot spots that display the detail view of the selected symbol.&nbsp; To activate the hot spot,
click once on the symbol name to select it and press ENTER to reveal the detail view.
<LI>Click once on the file folder to reveal the detail view for that symbol.
<LI>Click once on the symbol name to select it and choose<B> Detail</B> from the<B> Detail</B> menu.
<LI>Double click on the symbol name.

<H3 ID="The_Class_Inheritance_View"> The Class Inheritance View </H3>
<BR>Selecting<B> Inheritance</B> from the<B> View</B> menu displays the inheritance hierarchy of all of the C++ classes in
your program using a tree.&nbsp; This allows you to see the relationships between base classes and derived classes.&nbsp;
In the inheritance hierarchy, each node represents a class.
<BR><BR><TT><IMG SRC="brow5.bmp" ALIGN=MIDDLE></TT>
<BR><B><I>Figure 34.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> The Inheritance view displays the hierarchy of all C++ classes in your program
(graph view shown).</B>
<BR><BR>There are two different tree views you can choose from to display the class hierarchy:
<DL>
<DT>Graph view
<DD>The graph view displays each class in a box.&nbsp; A box, or node, is connected to another node if one is a derived class
of the other.&nbsp; The root node of the tree is the base class for all nodes in the tree.&nbsp; The tree is initially fully
expanded.&nbsp; See the section entitled <A HREF="#Manipulating_the_Tree_Views">Manipulating the Tree Views</A> for more information
on removing and expanding nodes from the tree.
<DT>Outline view
<DD>The outline view displays the same information as the graph view but in a different way.&nbsp; The outline view is initially
fully collapsed.&nbsp; That is, only the base classes are displayed.&nbsp; In order to view the derived classes of a node,
you must single click on the node.&nbsp; This expands the node, displaying all its immediate derived classes.&nbsp; See the
section entitled <A HREF="#Manipulating_the_Tree_Views">Manipulating the Tree Views</A> for more information on removing and
expanding nodes from the tree.
</DL>
<H3 ID="The_Function_Call_Tree_View"> The Function Call Tree View </H3>
<BR>Selecting<B> Call</B> from the<B> View</B> menu displays the function call tree for all functions in your program.&nbsp;
This allows you to see all the functions that a given function calls and conversely all functions that call a certain function.
&nbsp;In the call tree, each node represents a function.
<BR><BR><TT><IMG SRC="brow6.bmp" ALIGN=MIDDLE></TT>
<BR><B><I>Figure 35.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> The Call view displays a call tree for all functions in your program (outline

other.&nbsp; The tree is initially fully expanded.&nbsp; See the section entitled <A HREF="#Manipulating_the_Tree_Views">Manipulating the Tree Views</A>
for more information on removing and expanding nodes from the tree.
<DT>Outline view
<DD>The outline view displays the same information as the graph view but in a different way.&nbsp; The outline view is initially

<H3 ID="Manipulating_the_Tree_Views"> Manipulating the Tree Views </H3>
<BR>With both the graph view and the outline view you can change the information displayed in the following ways:
<UL>
<LI>select the root nodes you want to view
<LI>expand any node in the view
<LI>collapse any node in the view
</UL>
<BR>You expand and collapse nodes in the graph and outline views to hide and reveal descendant and ancestor nodes of the selected
node.&nbsp; There are two ways to expand and collapse nodes:
<UL>
<LI>choose the desired function from the<B> Tree</B> menu
<LI>click on the node (applies only to the outline view)
</UL>
<BR>In addition to these functions, you can force the graph to be redrawn when a node in the tree view is collapsed.&nbsp;
By default, collapsed nodes will leave a gap in the graph.&nbsp; Redrawing the graph removes these gaps.&nbsp; This feature
is controlled by an option.&nbsp; See the section entitled <A HREF="#Configuring_the_Browser">Configuring the Browser</A>
for more information.
<BR><BR>Clicking on the right mouse button when the mouse cursor is in a tree view will automatically display the<B> Tree</B>

<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Choose Set Text Editor</B> from the Options menu.
<BR><BR>The Set Text Editor dialog appears.&nbsp; You can enter the name of the text editor in the first field.&nbsp; You
must also indicate whether the text editor is an executable file or a Dynamic Link Library (DLL).&nbsp; If the editor is an
executable file (rather than a DLL), then you can enter an argument line in the second field.&nbsp; The argument line will
be supplied to the editor whenever it is started by the Browser.&nbsp; The argument line can include any of three different
macros which will be filled in by the Browser.&nbsp; The macros are:
<DL>
<DT>%f
<DD>The name of the file to be edited.
<DT>%r
<DD>The row in the file at which to position the cursor.&nbsp; If the editor is invoked from a diagnostic message which contains
a line number then the row value is extracted from the message; otherwise the row value is 1.
<DT>%c
<DD>The column in the file at which to position the cursor.&nbsp; If the editor is invoked from a diagnostic message which contains
a column number then the column value is extracted from the message; otherwise the column value is 1.
</DL>
<BR>For example, if the editor argument line that you specified was:

<H1 ID="Profile_Analysis_Tools"> Profile Analysis Tools </H1>
<BR>This section describes how to use the profile analysis tools to enhance the performance of your program.&nbsp; There are
two profile analysis tools:
<UL>
<LI>The Open Watcom Execution Sampler (the sampler)
<LI>The Open Watcom Execution Profiler (the profiler)
</UL>
<BR>You must use both of these tools to discover where your code is spending time as it executes.
<BR><BR>First, you must run the<B> Sampler</B>.&nbsp; The sampler starts your application and, at a predetermined interval,
records the location where your program is executing.&nbsp; This information is saved in a &quot;sample file&quot;.&nbsp;
It is a statistical sampling of your program's execution.&nbsp; It is not exact information, but it is accurate enough to
be a very useful tool to enhance your program's performance.&nbsp; See <A HREF="#The_Open_Watcom_Execution_Sampler">The Open Watcom Execution Sampler</A>.
<BR><BR>Second, you run the<B> Profiler</B>.&nbsp; It reads the sample file and displays the sample information graphically.
&nbsp;You can use the profiler to examine the sample data and narrow in on the places where your program spends large amounts
of time.&nbsp; See <A HREF="#The_Open_Watcom_Execution_Profiler">The Open Watcom Execution Profiler</A>.
<BR><BR>Once you have discovered heavily executed portions of your program, you might want to rewrite then using a faster
algorithm or fine tune your implementation of the current algorithms.
<DL>

<H2 ID="Sampler_Command_Line_Options"> Sampler Command Line Options </H2>
<BR>Command line options allow you to control how much the program's execution will be affected by the presence of the sampler.
&nbsp;System specific options are described in detail in subsequent sections.&nbsp; The options that apply to all versions
of the sampler are:
<DL>
<DT>/r=&lt;sample_rate&gt;
<DD>Specifies the approximate time between execution samples (in milliseconds).&nbsp; The sampler will set up the system so that
the program will be interrupted in intervals of the number of milliseconds specified on the command line.&nbsp; A smaller
number will result in a more accurate sample file.&nbsp; A larger number result in a less accurate sample.&nbsp; If your program
runs for a very short time, you should use the smallest interval possible.&nbsp; The default value is system dependent and
it will be displayed if you enter &quot;WSAMPLE&quot; with no arguments.&nbsp; The following example will sample the program's
execution 200 times per second.
<BR><BR><B>Example:</B>
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&gt;wsample /r=5 program</TT>
<DT>/b=&lt;buffer_size&gt;
<DD>Specifies the size of the sampler's internal buffer (in kilobytes).&nbsp; The execution of the program will produce many samples
which must be recorded in the sample file.&nbsp; The sampler stores the samples in an internal buffer until the buffer is
filled and must be written to the disk.&nbsp; You may reduce the buffer size if you want to leave more memory for your application
program.&nbsp; You should not make the buffer size so small that the sampler would have to write samples to disk more than
once a second.&nbsp; The default size for the sample buffer is 63K.&nbsp; In the following example, a buffer size of 10K will
be used:
<BR><BR><B>Example:</B>
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&gt;wsample /b=10 program</TT>
<DT>/f=&lt;fname&gt;
<DD>Specify the name of the sample file.&nbsp; Samples will be written to the specified file.&nbsp; By default, a file with the
same name as the executable and an extension of .SMP is created.
</DL>
<H2 ID="Sampler_Operating_System_Considerations"> Sampler Operating System Considerations </H2>
<BR>There is a different version of the sampler to match each operating system.&nbsp; Some systems do not allow the sample
rate to be adjusted.&nbsp; Each sampler will provide information about any unique aspects of its operation when you type its
program name on the command line.
<BR><BR><B>Example:</B>
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&gt;wsample</TT>

<BR>The sampler for an operating system such as DOS will not operate correctly in an environment that is not strictly DOS
such as a Windows or OS/2 DOS box.&nbsp; The sampler obtains its information about what was executing when a timer interrupt
occurs from the stack.&nbsp; Unlike &quot;real&quot; DOS, the segment/offset on the stack in a protected-mode environment
supporting Virtual DOS Machines does not correspond to the program that was executing at the time of the timer interrupt.
&nbsp;As a result, you must run the sampler in the real operating system environment for which it was designed.&nbsp; The
same is true for Windows applications in a Win-OS/2 session.
<H3 ID="Using_the_Sampler_with_DOS"> Using the Sampler with DOS </H3>

<DD>Rates from 1ms to 55ms are allowed.
<DT>/b=&lt;size&gt;
<DD>Sizes from 1K to 64K are allowed.&nbsp; Since DOS places a limit on the amount of memory available to all programs, you may
need to use the &quot;b&quot; option to reduce the memory requirements of the sampler, leaving more memory for your program.
<DT>/f=&lt;file&gt;
<DD>Specify the name of the sample file.
<DT>/i=&lt;interrupt&gt;
<DD>specify an interrupt to monitor
<BR><BR>This option allows you to assign any samples that occur while a service interrupt is executing to the instruction
following the requesting INT instruction.&nbsp; This will reveal the amount of time code spends &quot;waiting&quot; for interrupt
services.&nbsp; The interrupt number specified is in base 16 (hex) and can be in the range 20 to ff except for the range 34
to 3d which is reserved for 80x87 emulation.

<DT>/d
<DD>disable monitoring of the DOS interrupt
<BR><BR>By default, the DOS version of the sampler assigns any samples that occur while a DOS interrupt is executing to the
instruction following the requesting INT 21H instruction.&nbsp; This will reveal the amount of time code spends &quot;waiting&quot;
for DOS to complete a service.&nbsp; This option can be used to disable this assignment of samples so that the total time
spent executing in DOS code may be determined.

<H2 ID="ZoomMIn_and_Backout"> Zoom-In and Backout </H2>
<BR>The profiler allows you to<B> zoom-in</B> to successively more detailed views of your program.&nbsp; You may also<B> back-out</B>
of any detail view.&nbsp; The levels of detail available are:
<DL>
<DT>Sample
<DD>This is a sample file.&nbsp; The profiler can show you information from several sample files at once.
<DT>Image
<DD>A sample file may consist of several images.&nbsp; These are your main executable file and any Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL)
or NetWare Loadable Modules (NLM) that your application called while executing.
<DT>Modules
<DD>An image may consist of several modules.&nbsp; Each module is a compilation unit.&nbsp; It consists of all the source code
generated by one invocation of the compiler.
<DT>Files
<DD>A module may be made up of several files.&nbsp; Your application may contain code that is generated by included files.
<DT>Functions
<DD>A file may contain several functions.&nbsp; These are all of the global functions that are defined within that file.
<DT>Source Lines
<DD>A function is made up of one or more source lines.
<DT>Assembler instructions
<DD>Each source line generates zero or more lines of assembler instructions.&nbsp; It is possible to get clues about expensive
operations from the number of samples found at each instruction.&nbsp; For example, the C statement &quot;i = j + k * l&quot;
will generate a multiply instruction.&nbsp; If you inspected the assembler instructions, you might find that the multiply
instruction took the majority of the time in question.
</DL>
<BR>The process of moving from higher levels to lower levels, say, from &quot;modules&quot; to &quot;functions&quot;, is called<B>
zooming in.</B>&nbsp; Moving from lower levels to higher levels (&quot;assembler instructions&quot; to &quot;source lines&quot;)
is called<B> backing out.</B>&nbsp; As you zoom into your program the size of the region will get smaller but the amount of
detail will increase.&nbsp; Likewise, backing out will restore previous levels to the larger regions and reduced detail.&nbsp;
You may zoom-in and back-out of detail views in order to explore your applications execution characteristics.
<H2 ID="Samples"> Samples </H2>
<BR>After you have run the sampler, you are left with a sample file.&nbsp; It contains a record of all locations where your
program was interrupted by the sampler.&nbsp; A<B> sample</B> is a record of the instruction pointer within the program at
the point in time that the interrupt occurred.&nbsp; Regions of the program that consume large amounts of execution time have
a larger number of samples associated with them.
<H2 ID="Absolute_and_Relative_Percentages"> Absolute and Relative Percentages </H2>
<BR>The most important piece of data that the profiler provides is the percentage of time that a region of code contributes
to total execution time.&nbsp; At the highest level (images), these percentages reflect each image's contribution to the total
execution time.&nbsp; As you successively zoom into modules and functions, you may become interested in the relative percentages.
<BR><BR>The percentage of time that a region contributes to the total program execution time of the<B> program</B> is called
an<B> absolute</B> percentage.&nbsp; The percentage of time that a piece of a region contributes to the total execution time<B>
of your current detail level</B> is called a<B> relative</B> percentage.
<BR><BR>As you zoom in to the source and assembly views, the absolute percentages of execution time may get quite small.&nbsp;
The relative percentages help you to get a feel for the proportion of time involved within the detail view, but don't get
fooled into thinking that a routine contributes more than it actually does.&nbsp; Your decisions about which code to optimize
should always be based on absolute percentages.

absolute bar would take 10% of the histogram area.&nbsp; If the entire digital view represented 20% of the execution time,
then the single detail line would have a green and red bar which would take 50% of the histogram area (10% is half the total
time of the entire detail view).

<H2 ID="How_to_Use_the_Profiler_Effectively"> How to Use the Profiler Effectively </H2>
<BR>The fundamental principle behind the profiler is:<B>&nbsp; devote your attention to the heavily executed regions of the
program in order to extract the most performance out of a program.</B>&nbsp; This principle can be applied to the different
levels of detail within a program.&nbsp; You should focus on the modules that contribute the most time to the execution of
a program.&nbsp; Within a module, you should focus on the functions that contribute the most time to the module's total execution
time.&nbsp; Regions of the program that exhibit heavy use during the execution of a program will benefit most from improvement.
<BR><BR>A simple example will illustrate how this is accomplished.&nbsp; Suppose we have a program that has three distinct
regions.
<DL>
<DT><B><I>Region</I></B>
<DD><B><I>Percentage</I></B>
<DT>1
<DD>10%
<DT>2
<DD>70%
<DT>3
<DD>20%
</DL>
<BR>The percentages represent the percentage of the total execution time that the region contributed.&nbsp; If the program
took 100 seconds to execute, we could know that regions 1, 2, and 3 took 10, 70, and 20 seconds respectively.&nbsp; Now suppose
we could rewrite region 1 so that it was twice as fast.&nbsp; What would be the impact on the total execution time of the
program?&nbsp; It is difficult to predict precisely but, as a rule of thumb, we would expect that if we made region 1 twice
as fast, it would only take 5% of the original execution time as opposed to the original 10% before optimization.&nbsp; So,
if the original program took 100 seconds to execute, we would expect region 1's contribution of time to drop from 10 seconds
to 5 seconds making the execution time of the new program now 95 seconds.&nbsp; Notice that the region of code was twice as
fast as before but the total effect on the execution of the program was small.&nbsp; The impact of rewriting the code was
reduced because the region did not contribute greatly to the execution time of the original program.
<BR><BR>To illustrate the point of using a profiler tool to increase performance, let us now look at the effect on the program
execution speed if we were to recode region 2 so that it was twice as fast as before.&nbsp; Using the previous rule of thumb,
we would expect region 2's contribution to the original execution time to drop from 70% to 35%.&nbsp; Now, if the original
program took 100 seconds to execute, we would have reduced the total execution time to 65 seconds by focusing on region 2.
&nbsp;Comparing these results, we can see that the most benefit was derived from doubling the speed of region 2 as opposed
to doubling the speed of region 1.&nbsp; The change in region 2 reduced the execution time by 35% while the change to region
1 reduced the execution time by 5% for roughly the same amount of work.&nbsp; The large amount of work involved in speeding
up code means that the most productive avenue is to focus on the heavily executed regions of the program.

a literal - where it cannot be mistaken as a range indicator.&nbsp; If a caret (^) occurs as the first character inside the
brackets, then any characters NOT in the string are matched
<LI>A regular expression followed by an asterisk (*) matches a sequence of 0 or more matches of the regular expression
<LI>A regular expression followed by a plus sign (+) matches one or more matches of the regular expression
<LI>A regular expression followed by a question mark (?) matches zero or one matches of the regular expression
<LI>Two regular expressions concatenated match a match of the first followed by a match of the second
<LI>Two regular expressions separated by an or bar (|) match either a match for the first or a match for the second
<LI>A regular expression enclosed in parentheses matches a match for the regular expression
<LI>The order of precedence of operators at the same parenthesis level is the following:&nbsp; {}, then *+?, then concatenation,
then /.
<LI>All regular expressions following an at sign (@) are treated as case sensitive
<LI>All regular expressions following a tilde (~) are to be treated as case insensitive
<LI>If an exclamation point (!) occurs as the first character in a regular expression, it causes the ignoring of the<B><I>
magic</I></B> setting; that is, all magic characters are treated as magical.&nbsp; An exclamation point (!) is treated as
a regular character if it occurs anywhere but at the very start of the regular expression.
</UL>
<BR>If a regular expression could match two different parts of the line, it will match the earliest one.&nbsp; If both begin
in the same place, but match different lengths, or match the same length in different ways, then the rules are more complicated.
<BR><BR>In general, the possibilities in a list of branches are considered from left to right, the possibilities for *, +,
and ?&nbsp; are considered longest first, nested constructs are considered from the outermost in, and concatenated constructs
are considered leftmost first.&nbsp; The match that is chosen is the one that uses the earliest possibility in the first choice
that has to be made.&nbsp; If there is more than one choice, the next will be made in the same manner (earliest possibility)
subject to the decision on the first choice.&nbsp; An so forth.
<BR><BR>For example, (ab|a)b*c could batch the string<B> abc</B> in one of two ways.&nbsp; The first choice is between<B>
ab</B> and<B> a.</B>&nbsp; Since ab is earlier in the expression and does lead to a successful overall match, it is chosen.
&nbsp;Since the<B> b</B> is already spoken for, the<B> b*</B> must match its last possibility since it must respect the earlier
choice.
<BR><BR>If there are no |'s present and only one *m, +, or ?, the net effect is that the longest possible match will be chosen.
&nbsp;So<B> ab</B> presented with xabbbby, will match<B> abbbbb.</B>&nbsp; Note that is<B> ab*</B> is tried against<B> xabyabbbz,</B>
it will match<B> ab</B> just after<B> x,</B> due to the begins earliest rule.

<H2 ID="File_Matching_Regular_Expressions"> File Matching Regular Expressions </H2>
<BR>When specifying a file name in the Editor, it is possible to use a file matching regular expression.&nbsp; This expression
is similar to a regular expression, but has a couple of differences:
<OL>
<LI>A dot (.) specifies an actual dot in the file name.
<LI>An asterisk (*) is the same as .* (matches 0 or more characters).
<LI>A question mark (?) is the same as a regular expression dot (.); that is, a question mark matches exactly one character.
<LI>A caret (^) has no meaning.
<LI>A dollar sign ($) has no meaning.
<LI>The backslash (\) has no meaning.&nbsp; It is used to separate directories.
</OL>

<H2 ID="Controlling_Magic_Characters"> Controlling Magic Characters </H2>
<BR>By default, all special characters in a regular expression are magical; that is, if a special character is used, it has
a special meaning.&nbsp; To use a special character, like (, you must escape it (\().
<BR><BR>However, it is possible to change this using the<B><I> magic</I></B> setting in the General Options dialog.&nbsp;
If<B><I> magic</I></B> is turned on, then all special characters are magical.&nbsp; If<B><I> magic</I></B> is turned off,
then any special characters listed in<B> Magic String Edit Control</B> in the General Options dialog lose their special meaning
and are treated as regular characters.&nbsp; If<B><I> magic</I></B> is turned off and you want to use the characters in their
magical way, you must escape them with a \.
<H1 ID="The_Open_Watcom_Resource_Editor"> The Open Watcom Resource Editor </H1>
<BR><BR>The Open Watcom Resource Editor is a full-featured editor that enables you to easily create and edit resources and
the files that contain them.&nbsp; A file containing one or more resources will generally be referred to as a resource file.
&nbsp;A resource file may be an executable (.EXE), resource file (.RES), dynamic link library (.DLL), bitmap file (.BMP),
cursor file (.CUR), or icon file (.ICO).&nbsp; The editor also supports a variety of resource scripts.&nbsp; They include
dialog (.DLG), accelerator (.ACC), menu (.MNU), and string (.STR) scripts.&nbsp; This support is accomplished by maintaining
a synchronized resource file (.RES) in the same directory as the resource script.&nbsp; Opening a resource file reveals a
Resource window in the Resource Editor window.&nbsp; This window is a visual representation of the resource file.
<BR><BR>A resource is a piece of data with a specific format that Windows uses to create the visual and interactive elements
of your application.&nbsp; Most of the visual aspects of Windows applications are the result of the application having resources,
all of which can be created using the Open Watcom Resource Editor.&nbsp; Use the Resource Editor to create and edit the following
resource types:
<UL>
<LI>Accelerators
<LI>Bitmaps
<LI>Cursors
<LI>Dialogs
<LI>Icons
<LI>Menus
<LI>Strings
</UL>
<BR>When designing your application's user interface, the resources are separate from the application's source code.&nbsp;
This makes changing the user interface a simple task.&nbsp; Instead of accessing the application's source code, you can make
the changes directly to the resources.&nbsp; You can manipulate some aspects of the resources, such as the memory flags and
resource names, without invoking the resource's associated editor.&nbsp; Invoking the desired editor from the Resource Editor
enables you to change all aspects of the selected resource.
<BR><BR>Different applications often use the same or similar resources, such as bitmaps, icons, dialogs, and menus.&nbsp;
The Resource Editor enables you to create resource files for a new application by reusing existing resources.&nbsp; Copying
a resource from existing applications into the new resource file makes the task of creating your user interface quick and
simple.

<H1 ID="The_Open_Watcom_Accelerator_Editor"> The Open Watcom Accelerator Editor </H1>
<BR>The Accelerator Editor enables you to create and edit accelerator items so you can invoke menu items without using a mouse.
&nbsp;Accelerators define hot keys for menu items in your application.&nbsp; These enhance the user interface for more advanced
users of the application.
<BR><BR>Accelerators are keyboard equivalents for menu items, such as Ctrl+S or F2.&nbsp; For example, many applications associate
the accelerator Ctrl+C with the Copy item in the Edit menu.<B><I>&nbsp; The Windows Interface:&nbsp; An Application Design
Guide</I></B> suggests some standard accelerators.
<BR><BR>An accelerator item is made up of a key value, menu item identifier, and flags.&nbsp; These components define the
key combination the user presses to access the specified menu item.&nbsp; The Accelerator Editor stores the accelerator items
in an accelerator table.&nbsp; You can have multiple accelerator tables for a resource file.
<BR><BR>The accelerator editor allows you to create new accelerators and edit existing accelerators without having to create
a resource script or use a resource compiler.&nbsp; Without the accelerator editor, you would have to use the resource compiler
to add accelerators to your applications.

<H3 ID="Adding_a_New_Accelerator_Item"> Adding a New Accelerator Item </H3>
<BR>The steps for adding a new accelerator item to the accelerator table are the same, regardless of whether the accelerator
table is empty or already contains accelerator items.
<DL>
<DT>To add a new accelerator item:
<DD>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Position the cursor in the Key field.</B>
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Enter the desired key value</B> that will activate the menu item.
<BR><BR>You can enter a single key, such as a letter or number, or a key sequence.&nbsp; A key sequence may be made up of
a modifier and a key, such as ^k for Ctrl+k.
<DT>(3)
<DD><B> Enter a symbol or numeric identifier</B> for the menu item that is activated by the entry in the Key field.
<BR><BR>The symbol or numeric identifier you enter here is the identifier associated with the menu item.&nbsp; This relationship
is defined in the Menu Editor.&nbsp; If you do not know the desired menu item identifier, open the appropriate menu and look
up the identifier.&nbsp; It is not possible for the Accelerator Editor to get this information for you.
<DT>(4)
<DD><B> Specify ASCII or Virtual Key</B> in the Key Type section of the window.
<DL>
<DT>ASCII Keys
<DD>When the Key Type specified is ASCII, keys you press appear as characters, such as<B> a, B, 2,</B> or<B> $.</B>&nbsp; In the
Key field, the ASCII characters are surrounded by quotation marks.&nbsp; For example,<B> c</B> appears as<B> &quot;c&quot;</B>
and<B> Ctrl+C</B> appears as<B> &quot;^C&quot;.</B>&nbsp; When using ASCII characters as accelerators, you may combine them
with the Ctrl key to form key sequences, such as Ctrl+X or Ctrl+P.&nbsp; There is no symbol to represent the Shift key in
ASCII.&nbsp; Applying the Shift key with an ASCII character results in an upper case character in the Key field.&nbsp; For
example,<B> Shift+d</B> appears as<B> &quot;D&quot;.</B>
<DT>Virtual Keys
<DD>When the Key Type specified is Virtual Key, you enter the standard Windows identifier for the desired key.&nbsp; For example,
the Windows identifier for the Home key is<B> VK_HOME.</B>&nbsp; The header file WINDOWS.H defines these identifiers.&nbsp;
To avoid looking up these identifiers yourself, use the Key Value function explained in the section<B> Editing the Key Value.</B>
&nbsp;To specify whether the Alt, Ctrl, or Shift keys must be pressed with another key to form a key sequence, mark the appropriate
check box in the Modifiers section of the attributes area.
</DL>
<DT>(5)
<DD><B> Select the desired modifiers</B> in the Modifiers section.
<BR><BR>Modifiers are flags indicating keys that you must press in addition to the specified key value to activate the menu
item.&nbsp; When the ASCII option is selected, the Control and Shift modifiers are not available.
<DT>(6)

<H1 ID="The_Open_Watcom_Dialog_Editor"> The Open Watcom Dialog Editor </H1>
<BR>Dialogs are windows that contain controls such as push buttons, check boxes, list boxes, and combo boxes.&nbsp; Dialogs
are the principle medium for the exchanging of information between the user and the application.&nbsp; You include dialogs
in your application to prompt the user for information, enable the user to change settings, and allow the user to make choices.
&nbsp;Dialogs provide the medium through which users and your application can communicate with each other.
<BR><BR>The Open Watcom Dialog Editor enables you to create dialogs.&nbsp; With this editor you can design and test your dialogs
so you can see exactly how they will look and work in your application.
<BR><BR>The Dialog Editor allows you to create a new dialog or modify an existing dialog.&nbsp; When you complete the dialog
you can save it as a resource script or binary resource file.&nbsp; You can also save your dialog directly to an .EXE or .DLL
file if you originally loaded that dialog from one of these files.

<BR><B><I>Figure 104.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> The Dialog Editor edit window</B>
<BR><BR>The edit window gives you space so you can temporarily move controls off your dialog when it gets too crowded.&nbsp;
For example, to rearrange controls in your dialog, you can drag them onto the edit window and then drag them back onto the
dialog in the desired order.
<BR><BR>Although you can't see it on your screen, the edit window is an infinite grid with the origin (0,0) initially at its
top left.&nbsp; Dialogs are always positioned relative to the edit window.&nbsp; The origin is in the middle of the world
co-ordinate system, which is the reason the scroll thumbs are initially in the middle of the scroll bars.
<H3 ID="The_Workspace"> The Workspace </H3>
<BR>The workspace is the area under the Information Bar on which you can manipulate several resource files.&nbsp; This area
can be compared to your desktop.&nbsp; For instance, if you minimize an edit window, an icon representing that edit window
appears in the workspace.&nbsp; The workspace provides you with an area in which to open and close edit windows.

<H3 ID="Creating_New_Dialogs"> Creating New Dialogs </H3>
<BR>When you open the Dialog Editor, it displays an empty dialog box in the editor window of the Dialog Editor window.&nbsp;
You can change the size and location of this dialog and add controls to it to meet the needs of your application.&nbsp; However,
if you are not happy with the changes you have made and want to delete your dialog to start over again, or if you want to
modify more than one dialog at a time, you can create another empty dialog in one of the following ways:
<DL>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Select New</B> from the File menu.
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Select New</B> from the toolbar.
<DT>(3)
<DD><B> Draw another dialog</B> in the editor window with the &quot;dialog&quot; item from the toolbox.

and change its size and location within the edit window.
<H3 ID="Opening_Existing_Dialogs"> Opening Existing Dialogs </H3>
<BR>You can open a dialog from any .RES, .EXE, or .DLL file to your edit window where you can modify it.&nbsp; To do this:
<DL>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Open the file you want,</B> in one of the following ways:
<UL>
<LI>Select Open from the file menu, or
<LI>Select the Open button from the toolbar.
</UL>
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Select the .RES, .EXE, or .DLL file</B> that contains the dialog you want to copy.
<BR><BR>The Open Watcom Dialog Editor Open Resource dialog appears.
<DT>(3)
<DD><B> Select the resource file you want.</B>
<DT>(4)
<DD><B> Select the name of the file you want,</B> in one of the following ways:
<UL>
<LI>Select the name and press OK, or
<LI>Double click on the name of the file.
</UL>
<BR>If there are any dialog resources in the file, the Select Dialog appears listing the names of all the dialog resources
that exist in that resource file.
<DL>
<DT>Note:
<DD>If the file does not contain any dialog resources, the main screen appears with an empty edit window and dialog for you to
add controls and modify.
</DL>
<DT>(5)
<DD><B> Select one or more dialogs to place in the edit window</B> in one of the following ways:
<UL>
<LI>Double click on the dialogs you wish to modify, or
<LI>Select the dialogs you wish to modify and select OK.
</UL>
<BR>The dialog you copied appears in the edit window of your main screen.&nbsp; From here you can add controls to the dialog
and modify its size and location.
</DL>
<H3 ID="Changing_the_Dialog_Size"> Changing the Dialog Size </H3>
<BR>To modify the size of a dialog,
<DL>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Select the dialog.</B>
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Position the mouse</B> above the appropriate sizing handle.
<DT>(3)
<DD><B> Drag the dialog's sizing handle</B> until the dialog is the size you want.
</DL>
<BR>You will notice that the dialog size information in the Information Bar will track the size of the dialog.
<H3 ID="Changing_the_Location_of_a_Dialog"> Changing the Location of a Dialog </H3>
<BR>Since you will want all parts of your dialog to be visible to your users and grab their attention, you can modify the
location of your dialog relative to the parent window.&nbsp; To do this:
<DL>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Position the mouse</B> either above the dialog caption or within several pixels of the dialog's border (while remaining
in the dialog).
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Drag the dialog</B> to the position you want in the edit window.
</DL>
<BR>You will notice that the dialog size information in the Information Bar will track the location of the dialog.
<H3 ID="Saving_Dialogs"> Saving Dialogs </H3>
<BR>It is a good idea to save changes to your dialog as you modify it rather than wait for the Dialog Editor to prompt you
when you close your dialog or exit the Dialog Editor.&nbsp; There are five ways to save dialogs.&nbsp; The two primary ways
to save a dialog are to select one of the following from the file menu:
<UL>
<LI>Save
<LI>Save As
</UL>
<BR>Selecting Save or Save As from the File menu saves the entire resource file in which your dialog resides, updating any
changes you made to your dialog in the process.
<BR><BR>In addition, there are three other ways to save your dialog.&nbsp; You can choose Save, Save As, or Copy To from the
Dialog menu.&nbsp; Saving a dialog from the Dialog menu only saves one resource - the currently selected dialog - not the
entire resource file which typically contains numerous resources.
<DL>
<DT>Warning:
<DD>If you choose to select Save or Save As from the dialog menu you will only be saving the current dialog and not any of the
other resources in the resource file.&nbsp; If you save the dialog under the same name as the resource file, you will overwrite
all the resources in that file and be left with a resource file that contains nothing more than your dialog.
</DL>
<H3 ID="Changing_the_Name_of_a_Dialog"> Changing the Name of a Dialog </H3>
<BR>The name of a dialog is the name associated with the dialog resource when you save it to a dialog resource file.
<BR><BR>To avoid name conflicts, (you can't have two dialog resources with the same name, in the same file) you will want
to change the name of your dialog (the editor gives you one as a default).&nbsp; Type in the edit field a name you want to
give your dialog or, if symbols have been loaded, you can select a symbol from the combo box.&nbsp; You can drop down the
combo list box and select a symbol from there.
<BR><BR><TT><IMG SRC="dia11.bmp" ALIGN=MIDDLE></TT>
<BR><B><I>Figure 106.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> The combo box is labelled &quot;ID&quot;.</B>
<H3 ID="Changing_the_Caption_in_a_Dialog"> Changing the Caption in a Dialog </H3>
<BR>A dialog's caption is the text that appears in the title bar of the dialog.
<BR><BR>You can type in the edit field of the Information Bar to change the caption's name.
<H3 ID="Adding_Controls_to_a_Dialog"> Adding Controls to a Dialog </H3>
<BR>Select a tool that will allow you to create controls by selecting an item from the Tools menu or from the toolbox.
<BR><BR>There are two ways in which controls may be drawn in the dialog.
<DL>
<DT>
<DD><B> Click the left mouse button</B> at the position where you would like the top left corner of the control to be.&nbsp; The
control will be created in its default size.
<BR><BR>or
<DT>
<DD><B> Press the left mouse button and drag out a rectangle.</B>&nbsp; Release the left mouse button.
</DL>
<BR>The tool box goes back to select mode when you draw a control (the current tool becomes the select tool).
<BR><BR>To draw more than one of the same types of controls without having to choose the control from the toolbar or menu
every time, choose the sticky tool which causes the tool to stay down.
<H3 ID="Modifying_Controls_in_a_Dialog"> Modifying Controls in a Dialog </H3>
<BR>Once you have created controls for your dialog you can modify the controls as follows:
<DL>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Double-click the control.</B>
<BR><BR>or
<DT>
<DD><B> Select the control and Press ENTER.</B>
<BR><BR>A Style dialog box appears.
</DL>
<BR>Once in the Dialog editor, you can define your dialog box.&nbsp; You can also add, change, group, reorder, move, resize,
ore delete dialog controls so that your dialog box functions the way you want it to.
<H3 ID="Ordering_Controls_in_a_Dialog"> Ordering Controls in a Dialog </H3>
<BR>There is an ordering associated with the controls of a dialog.&nbsp; This ordering is commonly referred to as the &quot;tab
order&quot; and controls which dialog control is highlighted next when you press the TAB or cursor keys.&nbsp; As you add
controls to a dialog, they are added to the end of the list.
<BR><BR>The Dialog editor allows you to change this ordering using a simple &quot;point-and-click&quot; technique.&nbsp; To
do this:
<DL>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Select the dialog</B>
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Select Set Order</B> from the Dialog Menu dialog

<DD><B> Press the Set Order button</B> on the toolbar
<BR><BR>Reselecting Set Order will terminate the ordering session and record any changes made.
</DL>
<BR>As you click the dialog controls you will notice two things.&nbsp; First, the buttons at the dialog controls top-left
take on a &quot;depressed&quot; look.&nbsp; This indicates a button you have already clicked.&nbsp; Second, the unselected
or unclicked buttons will reorder themselves to reflect any changes you have made so far.&nbsp; This will allow you terminate
the ordering session without having to click all of the dialogs controls.
<BR><BR>Clicking on a dialog control that is in the &quot;depressed&quot; or selected state will undo the new ordering you
have given it and it will go back to its original position.&nbsp; If a &quot;depressed&quot; dialog control already has its
original position then it finds the first available position.&nbsp; This feature is handy if you make a mistake and would
like to perform a quick fix.
<BR><BR>There may be a point in the ordering process where you decide to start over from the beginning.&nbsp; Instead of clicking
over all the dialog controls you have previously clicked or leaving and then re-entering the Set Order mode you may simply
double click the dialog control you wish to be first.&nbsp; This will undo all that you have done and make the selected dialog
control the first one.
<BR><BR>You may run into a situation where the first n dialog controls are correctly ordered but subsequent one are not.&nbsp;
Before you begin to click through the first n dialog controls note that there is a better way.&nbsp; Simply shift-click the
n'th control to accept the current ordering up to that point and proceed.

<BR>If you want to design visual resources such as bitmaps, icons, or cursors and add sizzle to your application's interface,
the image editor can help.
<BR><BR>The Image Editor is a visually oriented drawing tool with the power to draw all the visual resources you want - exactly
the way you picture them.&nbsp; This way, you can design effective bitmaps, meaningful icons, and communicative cursors.
<BR><BR>Of course, the Image Editor can help bring to life your new artistic achievements.&nbsp; But it can also copy visual
images from anything else you can see on your computer screen.&nbsp; For example, if you would like to incorporate a favorite
bitmap or icon from your desktop or even from another application, you can use the Image Editor's Screen Select option to
copy that image to your design grid where you can tailor the image to your exact specifications.&nbsp; Then, when you are
happy with your visual image, you can save it to an executable.
<BR><BR>Most of the sections in this chapter apply to all your visuals, but for more information on the specific type of visual
you are creating, see the sections specific to creating and editing your specific resource type.

<BR><BR>You cannot draw or copy images onto the screen itself.&nbsp; Instead, you must first create a design grid, a work
area on which you can design your visuals.&nbsp; You can create an empty design grid and draw your own visual or you can create
a design grid with an image from your desktop or another application already on it.&nbsp; Once you have an image on your design
grid you can edit it so it looks exactly the way you want.

</DL>
<H2 ID="The_Image_Editor_Color_Palette"> The Image Editor Color Palette </H2>
<BR>If you want to draw or fill a new visual in different colors, or change the colors of an existing bitmap, icon, or cursor,
the color palette allows you to select the colors you want.
<BR><BR><TT><IMG SRC="img5.bmp" ALIGN=MIDDLE></TT>
<BR><B><I>Figure 111.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> The Open Watcom Image Editor color palette</B>
<DL>
<DT>To select a color:
<DD>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Click either the left or right mouse button on the color</B> in the color palette that you wish to assign to that button.
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Select a drawing tool.</B>
<DT>(3)
<DD><B> Draw or fill</B> holding down the mouse button assigned to the color you want.
</DL>
<BR>For example, if you want to draw a red line:
<OL>
<LI>Create a design grid for the resource you want
<LI>Select a shade of red from the color palette.
<LI>Select the line tool from the toolbox.
<LI>Drag your cursor across the design grid.
</OL>
<BR>When you choose one of the 12 colors on the right of the color palette, the draw color will not be the same as the fill
color.&nbsp; Don't be alarmed.&nbsp; This is because they are not true VGA colors.&nbsp; The Image Editor creates them by
dithering two or more colors together so that, while the color appears solid in the view window, it is actually made up of
different colored pixels intermingled with each other.&nbsp; Since it is impossible to represent a single pixel-unit of a
dithered color, the draw color always differs from the fill color when you select a dithered color.
<H3 ID="Selecting_Screen_and_Inverse_Colors"> Selecting Screen and Inverse Colors </H3>
<BR>Unlike simple bitmaps, visuals such as icons and cursors usually require transparent or inverse colors.&nbsp; This is
so that they don't entirely obscure everything underneath them and so they can be seen no matter what color they happen to
be sitting on.
<BR><BR>When you create or edit an icon or cursor, you can choose the screen and inverse colors from the color palette.&nbsp;
Then, you can draw portions of your icon or cursor with those colors, so that these pixels blend into the background of your
application.
<BR><BR>Remember, if you want to use a specific color in your icon or cursor, make sure the color you want to use is not the
screen or inverse color.&nbsp; Reserve these two colors for drawing only the transparent portions of your icon or cursor.
&nbsp;And use the other 26 colors available in the color palette for regular drawing.
<DL>
<DT>To choose a screen color:
<DD>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Create a design grid</B> for a cursor or icon.
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Move your cursor</B> over the two squares beside the words Screen and Inverse, so that your cursor changes from a pointer
to a hand.
<DT>(3)
<DD><B> Double click on either square.</B>
<BR><BR>The Select Screen Color dialog appears.
<DT>(4)
<DD><B> Select the color</B> you want to use as your screen color.
<DT>(5)
<DD><B> Click on OK.</B>
<BR><BR>The dialog closes and the screen color and its inverse are assigned to the screen and inverse boxes in the color palette.
&nbsp;These will be the Screen and Inverse colors you can use to draw the portions of your icon or cursor that you want to
be transparent.
<DL>
<DT>Note:
<DD>When you select a color, its inverse is automatically selected for you.&nbsp; Try to find a screen color and inverse color
that you won't want to use in the foreground of your icon or cursor.&nbsp; For example, if you don't intend to use yellow
in your icon, select yellow as your screen color.&nbsp; The inverse color, blue, is automatically selected for you, so if
you intend to use blue in your icon, find another screen color that doesn't have blue as its inverse.
</DL>
</DL>
<H3 ID="Assigning_Colors_to_Mouse_Buttons"> Assigning Colors to Mouse Buttons </H3>
<BR>When you are drawing and filling in multiple colors, you may find it useful to assign colors to the left and right mouse
buttons.&nbsp; This way, you can draw in one color, and quickly switch to another color simply by pressing the opposite mouse
button.&nbsp; For example, if you find you draw mostly in black and red, assign black to the left mouse button and red to
the right mouse button.&nbsp; To do this,
<DL>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Select the black square</B> by clicking on it with the left mouse button.
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Select the red square</B> by clicking on it with the right mouse button.
<BR><BR>The colors assigned to the mouse buttons appear in the squares of the color palette marked L (for left) and R (for
right).
</DL>
<H3 ID="Hiding_and_Showing_the_Color_Palette"> Hiding and Showing the Color Palette </H3>
<BR>If you generally only draw in one or two colors or temporarily need more room on your screen, you can hide the color palette:
<UL>
<LI>Double click on the system menu icon in the corner of the Color Palette, or
<LI>Choose Show Color Palette from the Options menu.
</UL>
<BR>To reveal the color palette again, choose Show Color Palette again from the Options menu.
<H2 ID="The_Image_Editor_Status_Line"> The Image Editor Status Line </H2>
<BR>There are five sections in the status line.&nbsp; The first four sections provide information on the current image.&nbsp;
The fifth section displays hint text for the items in the menus, toolbar, and toolbox when you position your cursor over an
item and hold down the mouse button.

<H2 ID="Creating_and_Editing_Bitmaps"> Creating and Editing Bitmaps </H2>
<BR>If you want your applications to have visual impact, you can create and edit bitmaps.&nbsp; Bitmaps are graphical images
that can be as large as 512 x 512 square pixels representing such things as buttons, brush patterns, company logos, toolbar
items, wallpaper, and graphical elements in menus.
<BR><BR>Using the Image Editor you can create a new bitmap or you can create a bitmap from any other image on your desktop.
&nbsp;You can even copy a bitmap from another application on your desktop.
<DL>
<DT>To create a new bitmap:
<DD>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Choose New</B> from the File menu.
<BR><BR>The Image Type dialog appears.
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Select Bitmap.</B>
<DT>(3)
<DD><B> Click on OK.</B>
<BR><BR>The Bitmap Information dialog appears.&nbsp; This dialog prompts you for information about the dimensions of the bitmap
you want to create and the color scheme you want to work with.&nbsp; The Image Editor defaults to the dimensions most commonly
used for creating bitmaps, 32 pixels by 32 pixels.&nbsp; However, if you want to create a different sized bitmap, enter the
pixel width and height you want.&nbsp; The Image Editor also defaults to a 256-Color color scheme.&nbsp; Other color schemes
available are 16-Color VGA and 2-Color Monochrome.
</DL>
<BR>To copy a bitmap from your desktop or from another application on your desktop:
<DL>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Choose New</B> from the File menu.
<BR><BR>The Image Type dialog appears.
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Select Bitmap.</B>
<DT>(3)
<DD><B> Click on OK.</B>
<BR><BR>The Bitmap Information dialog appears.
<DT>(4)
<DD><B> Select the Screen Select button.</B>
<BR><BR>This option allows you to choose the size and contents of the newly created bitmap with images from your desktop or
from another application sitting on your desktop.&nbsp; The Image Editor ignores the limitations specified in the Bitmap Information
dialog and uses the dimensions you sweep out (up to 512x512 pixels).
<DT>(5)
<DD><B> Position the cursor at the image you want to select.</B>
<DT>(6)
<DD><B> Hold the left mouse button and drag the cursor</B> across the image you want to copy to your design grid.
<DT>(7)
<DD><B> Release the mouse button.</B>
<BR><BR>The image you selected appears on your design grid.
</DL>
<H2 ID="Creating_and_Editing_Cursors"> Creating and Editing Cursors </H2>
<BR>You can create and edit cursors that communicate to your users the mode or state of the application.
<BR><BR>You can create a new cursor or you can create an empty cursor and copy an image from your desktop or another application
onto your design grid.&nbsp; From there you can edit your cursor's appearance and set its hot spot.
<BR><BR>When you edit cursors, the Image Editor provides you with an extra tool called<B> Set Hotspot</B> This tool allows
you to select the exact pixel to which you want to assign the hotspot.&nbsp; The default hotspot is 0,0 (at the top left corner
of the design grid).
<BR><BR><TT><IMG SRC="img7.bmp" ALIGN=MIDDLE></TT>
<BR><B><I>Figure 113.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> The Set Hotspot tool allows you to select the hotspot</B>
<DL>
<DT>To create a new cursor:
<DD>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Choose New</B> from the File menu.
<BR><BR>The Image Type dialog appears.
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Select Cursor.</B>
<DT>(3)
<DD><B> Click on OK.</B>
<BR><BR>The Cursor Format dialog box appears.&nbsp; Since cursors should be standardized, you can only choose monochrome cursors
32x32 pixels.&nbsp; You cannot create a colored cursor.
<DT>(4)
<DD><B> Click on OK.</B>
</DL>
<BR>Cursors (and icons, too) differ from bitmaps in that they almost always include pixels that blend into the background
of your application.&nbsp; Unless you want a rectangular shaped cursor, you must assign special screen and inverse colors
to the &quot;blending pixels,&quot; so that they don't obscure the areas over which you move the cursor.
<BR><BR>Since you can only create black and white cursors, do not use black or white as your screen or inverse colors.&nbsp;
Instead, use one of the dithered colors as your screen color.&nbsp; The Image Editor automatically chooses the inverse of
the chosen dithered color.
<BR><BR>For more information on selecting screen and inverse colors, refer to the section entitled <A HREF="#Selecting_Screen_and_Inverse_Colors">Selecting Screen and Inverse Colors</A>.
<H2 ID="Creating_and_Editing_Icons"> Creating and Editing Icons </H2>
<BR>With the Image Editor, you can create icons that look exactly the way you want.&nbsp; Icons are usually the user's first
exposure to your application, so you want them to be as professional and meaningful as possible.
<BR><BR>You can create a new icon or you can create an empty icon design grid and use the Image Editor's Snap Bitmap option
to copy an image from your desktop to your design grid where you can edit it as desired.
<DL>
<DT>To create a new icon:
<DD>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Choose New</B> from the File menu.
<BR><BR>The Image Type dialog appears.
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Select Icon.</B>
<DT>(3)

<H1 ID="The_Open_Watcom_Menu_Editor"> The Open Watcom Menu Editor </H1>
<BR>Windows applications typically contain menus that enable users to initiate actions.&nbsp; When users see familiar menus
in the menu bar, such as the File or Edit menu, they may feel less intimidated by a new application and be more apt to explore
its capabilities.
<BR><BR>In an application you can have three types of menu items:
<UL>
<LI>Standard
<LI>Popup
<LI>Separator
</UL>
<BR>A standard menu item performs a function when selected.&nbsp; A popup menu item is a menu item with a sub-menu.&nbsp;
Selecting a popup menu reveals another menu list, rather than performing a function.&nbsp; A separator is a horizontal line
that separates groups of menu items within a popup menu.&nbsp; A resource file can have multiple menus.
<BR><BR>The Open Watcom Menu Editor enables you to create new menus and edit existing menus found in resource files.&nbsp;
A resource file may contain multiple menus.
<BR><BR>With the Menu Editor you can create all of the menus needed for your application visually, without having to create
a resource script or use a resource compiler.

<H2 ID="Using_the_Menu_Editor_Window"> Using the Menu Editor Window </H2>
<BR>The Open Watcom Menu Editor window contains a menu bar, toolbar, and status line to help you create and edit menus.&nbsp;
The rest of the window is divided into five sections:
<UL>
<LI>Resource Name Field
<LI>Preview Window
<LI>Attributes Area
<LI>Menu Item List
<LI>Action Buttons
</UL>
<BR><TT><IMG SRC="mnu4.bmp" ALIGN=MIDDLE></TT>
<BR><B><I>Figure 117.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> On the Open Watcom Menu Editor window, you create menus for your application.</B>
<H3 ID="Menu_Editor__Resource_Name_Field"> Menu Editor:&nbsp; Resource Name Field </H3>
<BR>The Resource Name field in the Open Watcom Menu Editor window contains the name of the menu currently being edited.&nbsp;
A resource file can contain more than one menu, so it is important that the resource names for the menu resources be unique.
&nbsp;The Resource Name field is not case sensitive and can hold up to 255 characters.&nbsp; You can enter a textual name,
a number or a symbol in this field.
<BR><BR>When you create a new menu, the Resource Editor assigns the default name MENU_# to it.&nbsp; You can rename the menu
using the Rename item in the Resource menu.
<H3 ID="Menu_Editor__The_Preview_Window"> Menu Editor:&nbsp; The Preview Window </H3>
<BR>The Preview window appears on the Menu Editor window above the menu item list.&nbsp; This window allows you to see how
the menu you are creating will look in the application.&nbsp; The popup menu items in the preview window are functional so
you can test your menu as you create it.
<BR><BR><TT><IMG SRC="mnu5.bmp" ALIGN=MIDDLE></TT>
<BR><B><I>Figure 118.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> The preview window allows you to see how the menu will look and work in the
application.</B>
<BR><BR>You can use the sample menu that appears in the preview window to test the behaviour of your menu items.&nbsp; For
example, by selecting top-level menu items in the preview window you can check the positions and breaks of your menu items
and separators.&nbsp; The preview window allows you to verify that your menus cascade properly and that other attributes function
properly, including inactive, grayed, and check marked menu items.
<H3 ID="Menu_Editor__Attributes_Area"> Menu Editor:&nbsp; Attributes Area </H3>
<BR>The attributes area provides information about the currently selected menu item.&nbsp; You can edit menu items using only
the fields in this area.
<BR><BR>The attributes area displays menu item details in five sections.&nbsp; Following is an explanation of each section.
<DL>
<DT>Item Text
<DD>The Item Text field contains the name of the menu item.&nbsp; Whatever appears in this field will appear in the menu.
<BR><BR>An ampersand (&amp;) in front of a letter in this field tells the editor to underscore that letter in the menu.&nbsp;
This automatically creates a hot key for that menu item.&nbsp; When using the menu, pressing ALT plus the underscored letter
activates that menu item.
<BR><BR>To specify a tab character, enter \t in this field.&nbsp; All text after \t in the Item Text field will be right justified
in the menu.
<DT>Item ID
<DD>The Item ID is the unique numeric identifier for the menu item.&nbsp; In the source code, you match the identifier to the
function the menu item is to perform.&nbsp; The Item ID applies only to normal menu items.&nbsp; Popups and separators do
not perform functions, so do not need an identifier.
<BR><BR>You can enter any number in the range 0 to 65535 in the Item ID field.&nbsp; Hexadecimal values can be entered by
prefixing them with 0x.&nbsp; Octal values can be entered by prefixing them with zero.
<BR><BR>The two Item ID fields contain:
<UL>
<LI>the numeric identifier of the selected menu item
<LI>the symbol information for the selected menu item.
</UL>
<DL>
<DT>Note:
<DD>Both Menu Item fields currently contain the same numerical information because the Menu Editor does not yet support symbols.
</DL>
<DT>Item Type
<DD>The Item Type section of the window indicates whether the selected menu item is a popup, normal, or separator menu item.&nbsp;
Following is a description of each menu item type.
<DL>
<DT>Popup
<DD>A popup menu is a menu item that has a sub-menu.&nbsp; When you select a popup menu, another menu appears.
<DT>Normal
<DD>A normal menu item is an item that performs a function when selected.
<DT>Separator
<DD>A separator menu item is a horizontal line that separates menu items to logically group menu items with similar functions.
&nbsp;When a separator is selected from the menu item list, the Item Text and Item ID fields are always empty because they
do not apply to separators.
</DL>
<DT>Attributes
<DD>The options in the Attributes section allow you to specify how the selected menu item will appear in the menu.&nbsp; Use the
check boxes to select the desired menu item characteristic.&nbsp; Following is a description of each option.
<DL>
<DT>Checked
<DD>When the Checked option is selected, the menu item appears in the menu with a check mark beside it.&nbsp; This is a graphic
only and does not affect the functionality of the menu item.
<DL>
<DT>Note:
<DD>Top level menu items cannot be checked.
</DL>
<DT>Grayed
<DD>When the Grayed option is selected, the menu item text appears in gray instead of black.&nbsp; This option also makes the
menu item inactive.
<DT>Inactive
<DD>When the Inactive option is selected, the menu item appears unchanged in the menu.&nbsp; However, this option prevents the
menu item from being selected.
</DL>
<DT>Break Styles
<DD>The options in the Break Styles section control the positioning of the menu items.&nbsp; The break styles you choose affects
the selected menu item and all menu items that follow that item.&nbsp; Following is a description of the available options.
<DL>
<DT>Help
<DD>The Help break option positions the selected menu to the far right of the menu bar.&nbsp; This option is available only for
top-level menus.
<DT>Menu
<DD>For top-level menu items, the Menu break option begins a new line in the menu bar, positioning the selected menu item on the
far left.&nbsp; In a popup menu, this break option creates a new column, positioning the selected menu item at the beginning
of the new column.
<DL>
<DT>Note
<DD>The Menu option overrides the Menu Bar option.
</DL>
<DT>Menu Bar
<DD>For top-level menu items, the Menu Bar break option performs the same function as the Menu break option.&nbsp; In a popup
menu, the Menu Bar break option creates a new column, beginning with the selected menu item and places a vertical line between
the columns.
</DL>
</DL>
<H3 ID="Menu_Editor__Menu_Item_List"> Menu Editor:&nbsp; Menu Item List </H3>
<BR>The menu item list displays the menu items in the current menu.&nbsp; Use this list to view the attributes of the menu
items listed.&nbsp; Select a menu item from the table by clicking on it.&nbsp; Details of the selected menu item appear in
the attributes area of the window.
<H3 ID="Menu_Editor__Action_Buttons"> Menu Editor:&nbsp; Action Buttons </H3>
<BR>The action buttons control how the information in the attributes area is handled by the editor.&nbsp; The Insert button
will use the contents of the attributes area to create a new entry in the menu.&nbsp; The Change button will use the contents
of the attributes area to modify the current entry in the menu.&nbsp; The &lt;&lt; (shift left) button will cause the current
menu item to become a subitem of its parent.&nbsp; This button is enabled only when the current item is the last item in its
parent menu.&nbsp; The current item will visually appear to shift left.&nbsp; The &gt;&gt; (shift right) button will cause
the current menu item to become the last subitem of the popup menu preceding it.&nbsp; This button is enabled only when the
item preceding the current item is a popup menu.&nbsp; The current item will visually appear to shift right.&nbsp; The Reset
button will discard the contents of the attributes area and reset them to those of the current entry in the menu.&nbsp; The
Insert button is the default button when the ENTER key is pressed and no other button has the focus.

<H1 ID="The_Open_Watcom_String_Editor"> The Open Watcom String Editor </H1>
<BR>To group together text strings in your application, you can use string tables.&nbsp; A string table is a list of strings
such as error messages, prompts, and other text you want your application to display.&nbsp; Each string in the string table
has a unique number, called an identifier, associated with it.&nbsp; When the application presents the user with a message,
it searches for the appropriate identifier and displays the associated string, regardless of the textual content of the string.
<BR><BR>The Open Watcom String Editor enables you to create string tables for your application.&nbsp; The String Editor stores
these tables in the resource file.&nbsp; You can have multiple string tables in a resource file, which allows you to logically
group the text strings for your application.&nbsp; Since a string table is simply another Windows resource that is separate
from the source code, you can use the String Editor to do such things as translate your strings into another language or make
your strings more concise without having to change the source code.
<H2 ID="Using_the_String_Editor"> Using the String Editor </H2>

<H3 ID="String_Text_Field"> String Text Field </H3>
<BR>The String Text field in the Open Watcom String Editor window contains the text for the string item you are defining.
&nbsp;Whatever appears in this field will appear in your application.
<H3 ID="String_ID_Field"> String ID Field </H3>
<BR>The two String ID fields contains:
<UL>
<LI>the identifier associated with the string item
<LI>the symbol information for the specified string
</UL>
<BR>Creating a string item automatically creates a relationship between the string item and its identifier, the String ID.
&nbsp;In your source code you reference the string item by its String ID.
<DL>
<DT>Note:
<DD>Both String ID fields currently contain the same numerical information because the String Editor does not yet support symbols.
</DL>
<H3 ID="String_Editor__Action_Buttons"> String Editor:&nbsp; Action Buttons </H3>
<BR>The action buttons control how the information in the attributes area is handled by the editor.&nbsp; The Insert button
will use the contents of the attributes area to create a new entry in the string table.&nbsp; The Change button will use the
contents of the attributes area to modify the current entry in the string table.&nbsp; The Reset button will discard the contents
of the attributes area and reset them to those of the current entry in the string table.&nbsp; The Insert button is the default
button when the ENTER key is pressed and no other button has the focus.
<H3 ID="Strings_List"> Strings List </H3>
<BR>The Strings list displays all of the string items in the current string table.&nbsp; The string items appear in ascending
numerical order by String ID.
<H2 ID="String_Functions"> String Functions </H2>
<BR>You can perform several functions with the String Editor.&nbsp; This section describes the following tasks:
<UL>
<LI>Adding a New String Item
<LI>Changing an Existing String Item
<LI>Deleting String Items
<LI>Saving String Items
<LI>Using Shortcuts to Create String Tables 
<LI>Changing Memory Options
</UL>
<H3 ID="Adding_a_New_String_Item"> Adding a New String Item </H3>
<BR>The steps for adding a new string item to the Strings list are the same, regardless of whether the Strings list is empty
or already contains string items.
<DL>
<DT>To add a new string item:
<DD>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Enter the text</B> that you want to appear in the application in the String Text Field of the Open Watcom String Editor
window.
<BR><BR>The text that will be displayed in your application appears exactly as you enter it in this field.
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Enter symbol or numeric identifier</B> fo the string.

code references the string.
<DT>(3)
<DD><B> Press the Insert action button</B> 
<BR><BR>or
<DT>
<DD><B> Choose Insert New Item</B> from the Strings menu.
<BR><BR>or

<BR><BR>The String Editor adds the new string item to the Strings list.&nbsp; The editor automatically arranges the strings
in order by String ID.
</DL>
<H3 ID="Changing_an_Existing_String_Item"> Changing an Existing String Item </H3>
<BR>You may want to change the text or identifier for a string item in the Strings list.
<DL>
<DT>To modify an existing sting table item:
<DD>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Choose the string table you want to work with</B> from the Resource window on the Open Watcom Resource Editor window.
<BR><BR>The String Editor window appears displaying all of the string items for the selected string table.
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Click on the string item</B> from the Strings list that you want to modify.
<BR><BR>The selected string item appears highlighted in the Strings list.
<DT>(3)
<DD><B> Change the String Item or String ID field.</B>
<DT>(4)
<DD><B> Press the Change action button</B>
<BR><BR>These actions update the selected string item with the modified string item details.
</DL>
<H3 ID="Deleting_String_Items"> Deleting String Items </H3>
<BR>These are two functions you can use to delete string items from the Strings list:
<UL>
<LI>Delete
<LI>Clear
</UL>
<BR>The Delete item in the Edit menu deletes the selected string item.&nbsp; You can delete only one string item at a time
with this function.
<BR><BR>The Clear item in the File menu deletes all string items in the current string table.&nbsp; This is a powerful function
and must be used carefully to avoid accidentally deleting an entire String list.
<H4 ID="Deleting_a_String_Item"> Deleting a String Item </H4>
<BR>To delete string items from the current string table one at a time:
<DL>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Select the string item you want to delete</B> from the Strings table by clicking on it.
<BR><BR>The selected string item is highlighted.
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Choose Delete</B> from the Edit menu
<BR><BR>or
<DT>
<DD><B> Select the Delete button from the toolbar.</B>
<BR><BR>The String Editor removes the selected string item from the Strings list.
<DT>(3)
<DD><B> Choose Update</B> from the File menu to save the string table changes.
</DL>
<H4 ID="Deleting_All_String_Items"> Deleting All String Items </H4>
<BR>To delete all string items in the current string table:
<DL>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Choose Clear</B> from the File menu
<BR><BR>or
<DT>
<DD><B> Select the Clear button on the toolbar.</B>
<BR><BR>A message box appears prompting you to verify that you want to clear all of the string items from the current string
table.
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Choose Yes, No, or Cancel</B> to continue.
<BR><BR>Choosing Yes removes all string items from the current string table.&nbsp; The Strings list is left empty.

<H3 ID="Saving_String_Items"> Saving String Items </H3>
<BR>There are three functions you can use to save string tables with the String Editor:
<UL>
<LI>Update
<LI>Save As
<LI>Copy To
</UL>
<BR>Each of these options performs a different type of save function.&nbsp; This section describes how to use each function.
<H4 ID="String_Editor__Update"> String Editor:&nbsp; Update </H4>
<BR>After modifying a string item in a string table, choose Update from the File menu on the String Editor window to save
the updated string table to the current resource file.&nbsp; This prevents the changes from being lost when you exit the String
Editor.
<BR><BR>The Update function updates the resource file only at the resource level.&nbsp; The resource file is not saved until
you perform a save at the Resource Editor level as well.&nbsp; Exiting the Resource Editor without saving causes you to lose
the string table changes made.
<H4 ID="String_Editor__Save_As"> String Editor:&nbsp; Save As </H4>
<BR>Choose Save As from the File menu on the String Editor window to save the current string table to another resource file.
&nbsp;A Save Menu dialog appears where you specify the resource file to which you want to save the current string table.
<BR><BR><TT><IMG SRC="str6.bmp" ALIGN=MIDDLE></TT>
<BR><B><I>Figure 128.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> On the Save Menu dialog, specify the resource file to which you want to save
the string table.</B>
<DL>
<DT>Important:
<DD>If the resource file to which you are saving the string table already contains resources, the existing resources will be discarded
and replaced with the string table you are saving.
</DL>
<H4 ID="String_Editor__Copy_To"> String Editor:&nbsp; Copy To </H4>
<BR>Choose Copy To from the Resource menu on the String Editor window to copy the current string table into an existing resource
file.&nbsp; A Copy To dialog appears where you specify the resource file to which you want to copy the current string table.
&nbsp;Unlike the Save As function, copying a string table to a resource file adds an entry to the list of resources rather
than replacing the existing resources with the new entry.
<BR><BR><TT><IMG SRC="str7.bmp" ALIGN=MIDDLE></TT>
<BR><B><I>Figure 129.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> On the Copy To dialog, specify the resource file to which you want to copy

<H1 ID="The_Open_Watcom_Resource_Compiler"> The Open Watcom Resource Compiler </H1>
<BR>The Open Watcom Resource Compiler (WRC) performs two functions.&nbsp; It converts human readable resource script files
(usually with the extension &quot;.RC&quot;) into machine readable resource files (usually with the extension &quot;.RES&quot;).
&nbsp;We call this process pass one.&nbsp; The Open Watcom Resource Compiler then combines this &quot;.RES&quot; file with
an existing executable file or dynamic link library.&nbsp; We call this process pass two.&nbsp; Pass two may also be run without
a &quot;.RES&quot; file to set flags or to produce a fastload section.
<BR><BR>The Open Watcom Resource Compiler can process Win16, Win32 and OS/2 resources.

<H3 ID="Differences_from_IBM_Resource_Compiler"> Differences from IBM Resource Compiler </H3>
<BR>Open Watcom Resource Compiler is largely compatible with IBM's OS/2 Resource Compiler, but there are some differences.
<DL>
<DT>Octal constants
<DD>Open Watcom Resource Compiler recogizes octal constants such as 007, 056 etc.&nbsp; Hence values such as 008 are considered
to be an error.&nbsp; This is consistent with IBM's RC version 5 and also consistent with the C/C++ language.&nbsp; In resource
files that need to be portable between RC versions, do not use octal constants and strip all leading zeros.
<DT>Expression parsing
<DD>There are differences in parsing statements such as
<BR><BR><B>Example:</B>
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #define IDR_ACCEL&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ICON&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IDR_ACCEL&nbsp; -1,&nbsp; 8, 40,&nbsp;&nbsp; 0,&nbsp; 0</TT>
<BR><BR>Older versions of IBM RC consider 'IDR_ACCEL' and '-1' to be separate tokens while Open Watcom Resource Compiler considers
them to be a single arithmetic expression.&nbsp; This is consistent with IBM's RC version 5.&nbsp; The correct and unambiguous
syntax is as follows:
<BR><BR><B>Example:</B>
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ICON&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IDR_ACCEL, -1,&nbsp; 8, 40,&nbsp;&nbsp; 0,&nbsp; 0</TT>
<DT>Binary resource files
<DD>Using the -zm switch, Open Watcom Resource Compiler produces resource files compatible with those that IBM RC produces, however,
the files are not always identical.&nbsp; In particular the ordering of dialog data within binary resource files is not always
the same between Open Watcom Resource Compiler and IBM RC.&nbsp; This has no effect on the semantics of such resource files.

<H2 ID="Using_the_Open_Watcom_Resource_Compiler"> Using the Open Watcom Resource Compiler </H2>
<BR>The command WRC is used to start the Open Watcom Resource Compiler.&nbsp; The Open Watcom Resource Compiler may be used
in a number of different ways:
<UL>
<LI>To compile a resource definition file and add the resulting resources to the executable.
<BR><BR>WRC is used as follows to accomplish this:
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrc [options] resource-definition-file [executable-file]</TT>
<BR><BR>The resource-definition-file must not have the extension &quot;.RES&quot;, &quot;.EXE&quot;, &quot;.SCR&quot;, &quot;.DLL&quot;
or &quot;.DRV&quot;.&nbsp; If no extension is specified for the executable-file then &quot;.EXE&quot; is assumed.&nbsp; If
executable-file is specified without an extension but is terminated with a period (&quot;.&quot;) then the default extension
is not added.&nbsp; If the executable-file is not specified then its value defaults to the filename specified for the resource-definition-file
with its extension changed to &quot;.EXE&quot;.
<BR><BR><B>Example:</B>
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrc life.rc</TT>
<LI>To compile resources separately.
<BR><BR>This causes the Open Watcom Resource Compiler to create a<TT> .RES</TT> file only.&nbsp; WRC is used as follows to
accomplish this:
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrc -r [options] resource-definition-file [output-file]</TT>
<BR><BR>The resource-definition-file must not have the extension &quot;.RES&quot;, &quot;.EXE&quot;, &quot;.SCR&quot;, &quot;.DLL&quot;
or &quot;.DRV&quot;.&nbsp; If no extension is specified for the output-file then &quot;.RES&quot; is assumed.&nbsp; If output-file
is specified without an extension but is terminated with a period (&quot;.&quot;) then the default extension is not added.
&nbsp;If the output-file is not specified then its value defaults to the filename specified for the resource-definition-file
with its extension changed to &quot;.RES&quot;.
<BR><BR><B>Example:</B>
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrc -r -bt=nt life.rc</TT>
<LI>To add a compiled resource file to an executable file.
<BR><BR>WRC is used as follows to accomplish this:
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrc [options] resource-file [executable-file]</TT>
<BR><BR>The resource-file must have the extension &quot;.RES&quot;.&nbsp; The defaults for the executable-file parameter are
the same as in the case of compiling a resource definition file and adding the results to an executable.
<BR><BR><B>Example:</B>
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrc life.res</TT>
<LI>To add multiple compiled resource files to an executable file.
<BR><BR>WRC is used as follows to accomplish this:
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrc [options] res-file [executable-file] -fr=res-file-2 ...</TT>
<BR><BR>The resource files must have the extension &quot;.RES&quot;.&nbsp; The defaults for the executable-file parameter
are the same as in the case of compiling a resource definition file and adding the results to an executable.
<BR><BR><B>Example:</B>
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrc life.res life.exe -fr wave.res</TT>
<LI>To compile an application that does not have a resource file.
<BR><BR>This is useful if you wish to set the Windows 3.x or Win32 version number, or sort load the segments (Windows 3.x),
or use any of the other executable modifying features of Open Watcom Resource Compiler.&nbsp; WRC is used as follows to accomplish
this:
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrc [options] executable-file</TT>
<BR><BR>The file specified for executable-file specified must have a &quot;.EXE&quot;, &quot;.SCR&quot;, &quot;.DLL&quot;

<DL>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Position the mouse pointer in the Zoom window.</B>
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Press the left mouse button and drag the mouse</B> outside of the Zoom window.
<BR><BR>Attached to the cursor is a box which acts as a magnifier.&nbsp; As you move the mouse, the screen sections over which
you drag this magnifier appear magnified in the Zoom window.
<DT>(3)
<DD><B> Position the magnifier on top of the screen area</B> you want to capture in magnification.
<DT>(4)
<DD><B> Release the mouse button.</B>
<BR><BR>Zoom captures the selected screen section in the Zoom window in magnification.
<DT>(5)
<DD><B> Make fine adjustments,</B> such as centering the captured image, using the scroll bars of the Zoom window.
<BR><BR>Scrolling is a standard Windows feature.&nbsp; However, with Zoom, you can see the magnifier move on the screen as
you scroll the captured image in the Zoom window.
</DL>
<H3 ID="Resizing_the_Zoom_Window"> Resizing the Zoom Window </H3>
<BR>Resizing the Zoom window can be done at two different times:&nbsp; before you zoom an area or while you are zooming an
area.
<BR><BR>Resizing the window before you zoom is a standard Windows operation.
<DL>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Position the cursor on the border of the window</B> until it turns into a double-pointed arrow.
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Press the left mouse button and drag the mouse</B> until the window is the desired size.
<DT>(3)
<DD><B> Release the mouse button.</B>
</DL>
<BR>While positioning the magnifier over an area of the screen to select it for magnification, you may find you want to increase
or decrease the size of the area you capture.
<DL>
<DT>To resize the window while zooming:
<DD>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Position the cursor in the Zoom window.</B>
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Press the left mouse button and drag the mouse</B> outside of the Zoom window.
<DT>(3)

<DT>(5)
<DD><B> Move the mouse to increase or decrease the size</B> of the magnifier.
<BR><BR>There is a maximum and minimum size for the magnifier.&nbsp; The resizing interaction is similar to resizing a regular
window.&nbsp; The Zoom window does not change in size until you release the right mouse button.
<DT>(6)
<DD><B> Release the right mouse button</B> when the magnifier is the desired size.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>Note:
<DD>When resizing the window while zooming, the Zoom window may overlap the selected screen area when you release the right mouse
button.&nbsp; When this occurs, the magnifier captures the image of the resize window, not the original screen area.&nbsp;
This only happens if the screen area you are selecting is close to the Zoom window.
</DL>
<H3 ID="The_Begin_Zoom_Item"> The Begin Zoom Item </H3>
<BR>The Begin Zoom item in the File menu allows you to scan the screen area without holding down the left mouse button.&nbsp;

option Configuring Zoom:&nbsp; is selected, Zoom refreshes the image displayed in the Zoom window at regular intervals, as
well as when the magnifier moves.&nbsp; This feature is useful when magnifying screen images that change frequently, such
as the seconds on the clock application Configuring Zoom:.
<BR><BR>When the enable auto refresh box in the configuration Configuring Zoom:&nbsp; dialog is checked you can enter a value
in the Interval field.&nbsp; This value specifies the interval in tenths of seconds that Zoom will wait between image refreshes.

paths.&nbsp; Choose the Configure item from the File menu.&nbsp; This opens the Heap Walker Configuration dialog box where
you customize the Heap Walker's behavior.
<BR><BR><TT><IMG SRC="hw2.bmp" ALIGN=MIDDLE></TT>
<BR><B><I>Figure 134.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> On the Heap Walker Configuration dialog, you customize the Heap Walker's behavior</B>
<BR><BR>The Configuration dialog is set up with defaults for all options.&nbsp; To reset all options to their defaults, click
the Defaults button.
<H3 ID="Heap_Walker__Configuring_the_File_Name_Paths"> Heap Walker:&nbsp; Configuring the File Name Paths </H3>
<BR>The Heap Walker window, the local heap window and the memory display windows all have file menus with save items.&nbsp;
When you choose the save item one in these windows the currently displayed information is saved to a filename generated by
heapwalker.
<BR><BR>These file names are generated based on the entries in the File name for...&nbsp; fields of the Configuration Dialog.
&nbsp;The File name for Global Saves affects filename generation for saves from the Heap Walker window.&nbsp; The File name
for Local Saves affects filename generation for saves from the local walk window.&nbsp; The File name for Memory Dumps affects
filename generation for saves from the memory display window.
<BR><BR>The file names for saves are generated from the entered file name as follows.&nbsp; If a path is specified for the
filename then the generated file will appear in the specified directory.&nbsp; The filename for the generated file is formed
by adding three digits to the end of the specified file name to form a new filename that is unique in the given directory.
<BR><BR>For example, if the File name for Memory Dumps field contains &quot;c:\mem\foo.txt&quot; then all files saved from
the memory display window appear in the directory c:\mem and have filenames such as &quot;foo000.txt&quot;, &quot;foo001.txt&quot;
and &quot;foo003.txt&quot;.
<BR><BR>Beside each file name field in the configuration dialog is a Browse button.&nbsp; Pressing this button opens a file
selection dialog where you can view your directory structure while picking the filename for that field.
<H3 ID="Heap_Walker__Configuring_Window_Behaviour"> Heap Walker:&nbsp; Configuring Window Behaviour </H3>
<BR>As well as file name options, the Configuration dialog contains six configuration options that you activate and de-activate
using check boxes.&nbsp; A description of each option follows.
<H4 ID="Save_Main_Window_SizeDPosition"> Save Main Window Size/Position </H4>
<BR>Activating this option causes the size and position of the Heap Walker window to be saved when you close the application.
&nbsp;The next time you open the Heap Walker application, the window appears with the same size and same position as when
you last closed it.
<H4 ID="Save_Memory_Window_SizeDPosition"> Save Memory Window Size/Position </H4>
<BR>Activating this option causes the size and position of the Memory Display window to be saved when you close the application.
&nbsp;The next time you open the Memory Display window, it appears with the same size and same position as when you last closed
it.
<H4 ID="Allow_Multiple_Memory_Display_Windows"> Allow Multiple Memory Display Windows </H4>
<BR>When this option is activated, you can open multiple Memory Display windows.&nbsp; The new window may open on top of an
existing window, but can be moved and resized as necessary.
<BR><BR>When this option is not activated, selecting a second object to view from the Heap Walker window closes the first
Memory Display window and opens the new Memory Display window in its place.
<H4 ID="Display_Memory_Info_Window"> Display Memory Info Window </H4>
<BR>When this option is selected a Handle Information or Selector Information dialog box appears whenever a Memory Display
window is opened.&nbsp; If this option is not activated the information box does not appear, but it can be opened by choosing
Show Info from the File menu in the Memory Display window.
<H4 ID="Auto_Position_Memory_Info_Window"> Auto Position Memory Info Window </H4>
<BR>The setting of the Auto Position Memory Info option in the Configuration dialog determines the default setting of the
Auto Position Info feature in the Memory Display window.
<BR><BR>In the Memory Display window, activating the Auto Position Info feature ensures that the information box is always
attached to the window.&nbsp; When deactivated, the Handle Information or Selector Information dialog box moves separately
from the Memory Display window.&nbsp; You can turn on the auto position feature by selecting Auto Position Info from the File
menu on the Memory Display window.
<H4 ID="Display_Resources"> Display Resources </H4>
<BR>When the Display Resources option is activated, Heap Walker displays a graphical image when you open the memory display
window for an object that represents a graphical resource.
<H3 ID="Heap_Walker__Saving_the_Current_Configuration"> Heap Walker:&nbsp; Saving the Current Configuration </H3>
<BR>Normally, Heap Walker saves the configuration information, such as the window size and position, only when the application
closes.&nbsp; Choosing the Save Current Configuration item from the File menu of the Heap Walker window causes Heap Walker
to save the current configuration information.&nbsp; This saves the main window and Memory Display window sizes and positions,
even if the Save Main window size/position and the Save Memory window size/position options in the Configuration dialog box
are not selected.
<H3 ID="Heap_Walker__Setting_the_Font"> Heap Walker:&nbsp; Setting the Font </H3>
<BR>The Font item in the File menu allows you to set the font, style, and size for the text in all Heap Walker windows.&nbsp;
This item opens the Font dialog box.&nbsp; Select the desired font details and click on OK to close the dialog and apply the
fonts.
<H2 ID="Walking_the_Global_Heap"> Walking the Global Heap </H2>
<BR>There are four lists of information you can display in the Heap Walker window.&nbsp; The Display menu allows you to choose
a list to be displayed.&nbsp; The lists Heap Walker can display are:
<DL>
<DT>Entire Heap
<DD>All of the memory objects on the global heap
<DT>Free Items
<DD>All of the objects that are not currently allocated
<DT>LRU Items
<DD>The least recently used list items
<DT>Selector List
<DD>All valid selectors
</DL>
<H3 ID="The_Entire_Heap"> The Entire Heap </H3>
<BR>Choosing Entire Heap from the Display menu displays a list of all the global heap in the Heap Walker window.&nbsp; The
global heap is a pool of memory set aside by the system from which all program memory is allocated.
<BR><BR><TT><IMG SRC="hw3.bmp" ALIGN=MIDDLE></TT>
<BR><B><I>Figure 135.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> Choosing the Entire Heap item displays the global heap.</B>
<BR><BR>The following are the column headings that appear when the selected display is Entire Heap, Free Items, or LRU Items.
<DL>
<DT>Handle
<DD>An identifier assigned by the operating system to each object on the global heap
<DT>Address
<DD>The physical address in memory of the first byte in the object
<DT>Size
<DD>The total number of bytes occupied by the object
<DT>Owner
<DD>The module that owns the memory
<DT>Flags
<DD>An indicator specifying the type of the object.&nbsp; The codes are F (fixed memory) and D (discardable memory).&nbsp; A blank
indicates that Heap Walker is unable to determine if the object is fixed or discardable.
<DT>Lock
<DD>An identifier indicating if there is a lock on the object.&nbsp; L1 indicates there is a lock on the memory; P1 indicates
there is a page lock on the object; a blank indicates there is no lock on the object.
<DT>Heap
<DD>An indicator specifying if the object has a local heap.&nbsp; The code Y indicates that the object has a local heap; a blank
field indicates there is no local heap.
<DT>Type
<DD>An indicator specifying the type of information in the object
</DL>
<H3 ID="Free_Items_List"> Free Items List </H3>
<BR>The Free Items list contains all objects on the global heap that are currently unallocated.&nbsp; Viewing the Free Items
list allows you to see how fragmented your free memory is.&nbsp; The Free Items list appears under the same column headings
as The Entire Heap list.
<H3 ID="LRU_Items_List"> LRU Items List </H3>
<BR>The LRU Items list contains all items in the system that are currently available to be discarded.&nbsp; The system discards
memory when there is not enough free memory to satisfy an allocation request from a program.&nbsp; Memory is discarded based
on a least recently used algorithm.
<BR><BR>Only the LRU list can be sorted by age.&nbsp; When sorted this way the objects appear in order from newest to oldest.
&nbsp;This means the first object on the list will be the last item to be discarded.&nbsp; This allows you to see the order
in which the system will discard objects.
<BR><BR>To sort the LRU list, refer to the section <A HREF="#Sorting_the_Lists">Sorting the Lists</A>.
<BR><BR>The LRU Items list appears under the same column headings as The Entire Heap list.
<H3 ID="The_Selector_List"> The Selector List </H3>
<BR>The selector list displays all valid ring three selectors in the system.&nbsp; This list also shows descriptor table information
about each selector.
<BR><BR><TT><IMG SRC="hw4.bmp" ALIGN=MIDDLE></TT>
<BR><B><I>Figure 136.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> The Selector List displays all valid ring three selectors.</B>
<BR><BR>You can view the data accessible by a selector by double clicking on its entry in the list.&nbsp; When you do this
a Memory Display window appears.&nbsp; Attached to this window is a Selector Information dialog box that contains the information
about the chosen selector that was displayed in the selector list.
<BR><BR>The following are the column headings that appear when the Selector List is displayed.
<DL>
<DT>Sel
<DD>The selector that information on this line refers to
<DT>Base
<DD>The lowest linear address accessible using this selector
<DT>Limit
<DD>The number of bytes of memory that this selector allows you to access.&nbsp; The greatest linear address accessible using
this selector is<B> Base</B> plus the<B> Limit.</B>&nbsp; (i.e.&nbsp; &lt;sel&gt;:&lt;limit&gt;)
<DT>Gran
<DD>The granularity of the selector
<DT>Type
<DD>A value indicating if this selector provides execute access.&nbsp; This value contains the value<B> code</B> if execute access
is provided.&nbsp; Otherwise the field contains<B> data.</B>
<DT>DPL
<DD>The privilege level for this selector.&nbsp; This determines the privilege level that a task requires to access this memory.
<DT>Access
<DD>The operations that are allowed on memory using this selector.&nbsp; The codes in this field are R (read), W (write), and
Ex (execute).
<DT>Big
<DD>A code indicating if the selector's B flag (bit 54) is set.&nbsp; A<B> Y</B> in this column indicates the flag is set.&nbsp;
A blank indicates the flag is not set.
</DL>
<H2 ID="Sorting_the_Lists"> Sorting the Lists </H2>
<BR>The items that appear in the Sort menu depend on the list selected from the Display menu.&nbsp; The Sort items allows
you to organize the displayed information, making objects easier to find.&nbsp; There are two ways to sort information in
Heap Walker.
<UL>
<LI>Choose the desired sort method from the Sort menu
<BR><BR>or
<LI>Click once on the column heading by which you want to sort.
</UL>
<BR>Only those headings appearing in the Sort menu change the organization of the displayed information when selected.
<BR><BR>The following is a list of the headings by which you can sort the displayed information.&nbsp; Some headings have
a secondary sort feature.&nbsp; For example, when you sort by Type, Heap Walker first sorts the Type field alphabetically,
then organizes objects of the same Type by Owner.&nbsp; Where applicable, the secondary sort appears in parentheses.
<BR><BR>For the Entire Heap, Free Items, and LRU Items lists:
<UL>
<LI>Address
<LI>Handle
<LI>Owner (secondary sort=Type)
<LI>Size
<LI>Type (secondary sort=Owner)
<LI>Flag
<LI>Age (available for LRU Items list only)
</UL>
<BR>For the Selector List
<UL>
<LI>Base Address
<LI>Selector
<LI>Limit
<LI>Granularity
<LI>Type
<LI>DPL
</UL>
<H2 ID="Viewing_the_Contents_of_Memory"> Viewing the Contents of Memory </H2>
<BR>You can view the data stored in an object that appears in one of the lists displayed in the Heap Walker window by double
clicking on the desired object.&nbsp; This opens a Memory Display window for the object.
<H3 ID="The_Memory_Display_Window"> The Memory Display Window </H3>
<BR><TT><IMG SRC="hw5.bmp" ALIGN=MIDDLE></TT>
<BR><B><I>Figure 137.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> The Memory Display window displays the data stored in the selected object.</B>
<BR><BR>The Memory Display window displays all of the data stored in the selected object.&nbsp; The data in this window appears
in hexadecimal form.&nbsp; The Memory Window is useful because it allows you to see if the data in memory is what you believe
it should be.&nbsp; Heap Walker cannot display the Memory Display window for free items or objects whose size equals zero.
<BR><BR>When you size the Memory Display window Heap Walker automatically reformats the information so that it is the same
width as the window.
<BR><BR>Some memory objects contain information representing graphical objects used by Windows, such as menus, dialogs, cursors,
and icons.&nbsp; When you display the data for one of these objects in the Memory Display window, Heap Walker also displays
the object in graphical form.&nbsp; Occasionally, this operation may fail for different reasons, including lack of memory
and the inability to read certain resource formats.
<BR><BR>If the object displayed is a menu then Heap Walker can tell you the constant associated with any item in the menu.
&nbsp;When the menu is displayed in graphical form simply select an item from it.&nbsp; Heap Walker will display a dialog
that shows the name of the item selected and the numeric constant associated with it.&nbsp; This numeric constant is the number
passed as the wparam parameter of a window's callback function when the menu item is selected.
<BR><BR>The Memory Display window is accompanied by an Information dialog box.&nbsp; This section describes the Information
dialog, as well as the various functions you can perform within the Memory Display window.&nbsp; Functions include saving,
setting the display, and setting the offset.
<H4 ID="Saving_Heap_Walker_Information_to_a_File"> Saving Heap Walker Information to a File </H4>
<BR>The Save items in Heap Walker allow you to save the information displayed in a window to a text file.&nbsp; Saving information
to a file allows you to do many things, including:
<UL>
<LI>print the output later
<LI>compare objects outside of Heap Walker
<LI>annotate the text file on-line
</UL>
<BR>Choosing Save from the File menu on the Memory Display window saves the data in the window to a file name generated by
Heap Walker based on the information in the Configuration dialog.&nbsp; A message box appears indicating the path to which
Heap Walker saved the file.
<BR><BR>Choosing Save As from the File menu allows you to specify the file to which you want to save the data currently in
the window.&nbsp; This opens a Save As dialog box where you select the desired file.&nbsp; Click on OK when completed.&nbsp;
A message box appears indicating the path to which Heap Walker saved the file.
<H4 ID="Changing_the_Heap_Walker_Display"> Changing the Heap Walker Display </H4>
<BR>There are five ways to display the information in the Memory Display window.&nbsp; You can display the information as:
<UL>
<LI>Bytes
<LI>Words
<LI>DWords
<LI>16-bit Code
<LI>32-bit Code
</UL>
<BR>To change the form of the displayed data, select an item from the Display menu.
<BR><BR>When displaying data in bytes, the data appears in the window as it physically appears in memory.&nbsp; When the data
is displayed as words, the bytes in memory are interpreted for you so that the values displayed are those that would be obtained
by treating the memory as an array of words.&nbsp; For example, if memory containing the values:
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12 34 56 78 9A BC DE FF</TT>
<BR><BR>was shown as words, the memory window would display:
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3412 7856 BC9A FFDE</TT>
<BR><BR>A similar interpretation is performed when the data is displayed as DWords.&nbsp; If the above memory was shown as
DWords, the memory window would display:
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 78563412 FFDEBC9A</TT>
<BR><BR>This rearrangement of bytes does not affect the textual interpretation of the data shown on the right hand side of
the window.
<BR><BR>Selecting 16 or 32 Bit Code from the Display menu presents the data in a disassembled form.&nbsp; Sometimes presenting
the data in disassembled form is not accurate.&nbsp; This is because when Heap Walker disassembles the data it begins at the
first byte of the memory block and disassembles it linearly.&nbsp; If a byte in this block, such as a padding byte, throws
off the sequence, the disassembly will be meaningless.
<H4 ID="Setting_the_Offset_in_the_Memory_Display_Window"> Setting the Offset in the Memory Display Window </H4>
<BR>In the Memory Display window, selecting the Set Offset item from the menu bar allows you to reposition the data so that
the specified line appears at the top of the window.&nbsp; The offset you enter appears on the first line.&nbsp; It will not
necessarily be the first piece of information because rounding often occurs to avoid breaking a line.
<DL>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Choose Set Offset</B> from the menu.
<BR><BR>This opens a Goto Offset dialog box.
<BR><BR><TT><IMG SRC="hw6.bmp" ALIGN=MIDDLE></TT>
<BR><B><I>Figure 138.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> In the Goto Offset dialog, enter the offset you want to appear at the top of
the Memory Display window.</B>
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Enter the desired offset</B> that you want to position at the top of the Memory Display window.&nbsp; You can enter the
offset in decimal or hexadecimal form.&nbsp; However, you must prefix hexadecimal values with 0x (e.g.&nbsp; 0x00000005).
<DT>(3)
<DD><B> Click on OK.</B>
<BR><BR>This closes the dialog and positions the data as requested.
</DL>
<H4 ID="Information_Dialog_Boxes"> Information Dialog Boxes </H4>
<BR>A Handle Information dialog box attached to the Memory Display window provides the information that appears on the Heap
Walker window for the displayed object.&nbsp; The information in this dialog is:
<UL>
<LI>Block Address
<LI>Block Handle
<LI>Block Size
<LI>Lock Count
<LI>Page Lock Count
</UL>
<BR><TT><IMG SRC="hw7.bmp" ALIGN=MIDDLE></TT>
<BR><B><I>Figure 139.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> The Handle Information dialog box displays information for the selected object.</B>
<BR><BR>When the selected display is the Selector List, the Selector Information dialog box is attached to the Memory Display
window.&nbsp; The information in this dialog is:
<UL>
<LI>Selector
<LI>Base
<LI>Limit
<LI>Type
<LI>DPL

<BR><B><I>Figure 140.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> The Selector Information dialog displays the Selector List information for
the selected object.</B>
<BR><BR>The information boxes stay with the Memory Display window when the Auto Position Info item under the File menu is
checked.&nbsp; Uncheck this item by selecting it again from the File menu.
<BR><BR>If the information dialog is not visible, reveal it by choosing Show Info from the File menu on the Memory Display
window.&nbsp; Close this dialog by double clicking on the system menu box in the upper left hand corner of the dialog.
<H2 ID="Working_with_Individual_Objects"> Working with Individual Objects </H2>
<BR>The items in the Object menu enable you to operate on the individual objects on the global heap.
<DL>
<DT><B>The Object Menu</B>
<DD>
<DT>Show
<DD>View the data stored in an object.
<DT>Get Selector
<DD>Show the Selector corresponding to a Handle.
<DT>Discard
<DD>Request that a discardable object be purged from memory.
<DT>Oldest
<DD>Reposition an object to become the oldest object on the LRU list.
<DT>Newest
<DD>Reposition an object to become the newest object on the LRU list.
<DT>Add
<DD>Calculate and display the amount of memory used by selected objects.
</DL>
<BR>These items allow you to quickly set up test situations while developing a program.&nbsp; For example, if you suspect
your program has a bug caused by the system discarding a particular object, you can use the Newest item to force the system
to keep that object.&nbsp; Similarly, you can discard an object that you suspect is causing a bug to see if your program runs
without it.
<BR><BR>Some items apply only to specific objects.&nbsp; To reposition and discard objects, the selected object must be a
discardable item.&nbsp; When the Selector List is displayed only the Show item is available.
<H3 ID="Viewing_an_Object_s_Memory"> Viewing an Object's Memory </H3>
<BR>Viewing an object's memory is useful because it allows you to see if what is actually in memory is what you think should
be in memory.&nbsp; There are two ways to view an object's memory:
<UL>
<LI>Double click on the desired object
<BR><BR>or
<LI>Click once on the desired object to select it and choose Show from the Object menu.
</UL>
<BR>This opens a Memory Display window for the selected object.
<BR><BR>You can save the information on this window to a file and change the way in which the window displays the memory information.
&nbsp;Refer to the section <A HREF="#Viewing_the_Contents_of_Memory">Viewing the Contents of Memory</A> for details on these
functions.
<H3 ID="Finding_a_Selector"> Finding a Selector </H3>
<BR>The Get Selector function locates the selector for any object with a handle.&nbsp; You need to know the selector to get
the logical address in memory of an object.&nbsp; This function is not available for free items or objects without handles.
<BR><BR>To find the selector for an object:
<DL>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Click once on the object whose selector you want to find.</B>
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Choose Get Selector</B> from the Object menu.
<BR><BR>This opens a message box which indicates the Selector that corresponds to the selected memory object.
<DT>(3)
<DD><B> Click on OK</B> to close the message box.
</DL>
<H3 ID="Discarding_an_Object"> Discarding an Object </H3>
<BR>The Discard item allows you to request that the system purge a discardable object from memory.&nbsp; Only objects marked
by the operating system as discardable can be discarded.
<BR><BR>Choosing this item is equivalent to making the API call GlobalDiscard for the selected object.
<BR><BR>To discard an object:
<DL>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Click once on the object you want to discard.</B>
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Choose Discard</B> from the Object menu.
<BR><BR>This opens a message box which indicates the Handle of the object discarded, as well as the number of bytes discarded.
<DT>(3)
<DD><B> Click on OK</B> to close the message box.
</DL>
<H3 ID="Repositioning_an_Object"> Repositioning an Object </H3>
<BR>Repositioning objects allows you to force discardable objects to be the oldest or newest object on the LRU list.&nbsp;
The system discards objects from memory when there is not enough free memory available to satisfy an allocation request from
a program.&nbsp; Giving an object the status Oldest ensures that if the system discards objects from memory, this will be
the first object discarded.&nbsp; Giving an object the status Newest ensures that when the system removes memory, this will
be the last object removed.
<BR><BR>To reposition an object:
<DL>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Click once on the object you want to reposition.</B>
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Choose Oldest or Newest</B> from the Object menu, depending on how you want to reposition the object in the list.
<BR><BR>This opens a message box which indicates the handle of the object that has been repositioned in the selected manner.
<DT>(3)
<DD><B> Click on OK</B> to close the message box.
</DL>
<H3 ID="Calculating_Memory_Size"> Calculating Memory Size </H3>
<BR>The Add function is a summary function you use to calculate the memory size of selected objects.&nbsp; This function may
be helpful in identifying memory leaks.
<BR><BR>A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but does not free it when the memory is no longer needed.&nbsp;
If a program has a memory leak it requires increasingly more memory as it runs.&nbsp; With the Add function you can quickly
determine the amount of memory being used by your program at any point in time.&nbsp; This allows you to determine if its
memory requirements are increasing over time.
<BR><BR>Choosing Add from the Objects menu opens an Add dialog box.
<BR><BR><TT><IMG SRC="hw9.bmp" ALIGN=MIDDLE></TT>
<BR><B><I>Figure 141.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> As you select objects, the Add function calculates and displays the number
of selected objects and their total size.</B>
<BR><BR>During an Add operation the global heap list acts as an extended selection list box.&nbsp; There are several ways
to select objects in an extended selection list box.&nbsp; The following describes three common selection techniques you can
use.
<UL>
<LI>Select one object by clicking on it.&nbsp; The Add dialog displays the size of the selected item.
<LI>Select multiple objects by holding the CTRL key and clicking on each object one at a time.&nbsp; The Add dialog displays
the number of objects selected and the total size of those objects.
<LI>Select many objects in a sequence by clicking on the first object and dragging the mouse while depressing the mouse button.
&nbsp;Release the mouse button when the last item in the sequence is highlighted.&nbsp; The Add dialog displays the number
of objects selected and the total size of those objects.
</UL>
<H2 ID="Walking_the_Local_Heap"> Walking the Local Heap </H2>
<BR>A local heap is a pool of memory set aside by an individual program from which only that program can make allocations.
&nbsp;Looking at the local heap allows you to see how your program is using the memory it is taking from the local heap.
<BR><BR>All items in the Local menu relate to objects with local heaps, so are only functional with such objects.&nbsp; Objects
marked with a Y in the Heap column have a local heap.
<H3 ID="Monitoring_Data_Segment_Usage"> Monitoring Data Segment Usage </H3>
<BR>Every Windows program has a default data segment.&nbsp; This block of memory contains the program's stack, local heap
and the memory for any static or extern variables that it declares (static data).&nbsp; If a program requires enough static
data that its default data segment grows beyond 64K then it must be recompiled for the large memory model and may encounter
problems when more than one instance of the program run simultaneously.
<BR><BR>The Monitor Local Heap item allows you to see how memory in a program's default data segment is being used so you
can optimize this by reducing the amount of stack space allocated to the minimum required or eliminate memory leaks that could
drive up the amount of memory required by the local heap.
<BR><BR>When you choose the Monitor Local Heap item a Local Heap Monitor window is opened.&nbsp; This window contains a scale
ranging from zero to the number of bytes in the selected data segment.&nbsp; The scale is divided into colored blocks which
illustrate how the memory for the object is used.&nbsp; Uses include:
<DL>
<DT>Fixed heap
<DD>memory occupied by fixed objects on the program's local heap
<DT>Free heap
<DD>memory occupied by free objects on the program's local heap
<DT>Moveable heap
<DD>memory occupied by movable objects on the program's local heap
<DT>Stack allocated
<DD>memory allocated for use by the program's stack
<DT>Stack used
<DD>memory actually used by the program's stack since the program began execution
<DT>Static data
<DD>memory used by the program's static data
<DT>Unknown
<DD>memory for which Heap Walker cannot determine a use
</DL>
<BR>Heap Walker updates this display continuously as memory usage changes.
<BR><BR>To view the usage of a program's default data segment:
<DL>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Click once on the object containing the default data segment</B> you want to monitor.
<BR><BR>This object will contain a local heap.&nbsp; A program's &quot;hInstance&quot; is the handle of its default data segment.
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Choose Monitor Local Heap from the Local menu.</B>
<BR><BR>The Local Heap monitor window opens which displays the usage scale for the selected object.

<H2 ID="Testing_with_Heap_Walker"> Testing with Heap Walker </H2>
<BR>Heap Walker provides various allocation functions that allow you to test your programs.&nbsp; By allocating and freeing
memory you can see how your program reacts in low memory situations.
<BR><BR>Each time you select the Alloc menu an Allocation Information dialog box appears on the screen.
<BR><BR><TT><IMG SRC="hw15.bmp" ALIGN=MIDDLE></TT>
<BR><B><I>Figure 147.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> The Allocation Information dialog provides approximate size information regarding
allocated and free memory.</B>
<BR><BR>The information in this dialog includes Kilobytes allocated (approximately), Kilobytes free, and Bytes free.&nbsp;
It is important to realize that the information appearing in this dialog is approximate.&nbsp; This information appear so
you can monitor the approximate amounts of memory you have allocated using an Allocation function.&nbsp; You should use this
information only when using an Allocation function.
<DL>
<DT>Important:
<DD>Do not use the Allocation functions under the Windows Debug Kernel as they can make your system unstable.
</DL>
<H3 ID="Allocate_All_Memory"> Allocate All Memory </H3>
<BR>To see how your program runs when all free memory is allocated, choose Allocate All Memory from the Alloc menu.&nbsp;
Choosing this item may change the appearance and performance of your application.&nbsp; This is normal because when there
is little memory available, the system may discard fonts that Heap Walker is using and swap information to disk more frequently.
<H3 ID="Free_All_Memory"> Free All Memory </H3>
<BR>Selecting the Free All Memory item frees all of the allocated memory.&nbsp; This returns to the system the memory taken
away using other Allocation functions.
<H3 ID="Other_Allocation_Functions"> Other Allocation Functions </H3>
<BR>The final three allocation functions-Allocate all but, Allocate, and Free-allow you to choose an amount of memory to allocate
or free.&nbsp; Perform these functions as follows:
<DL>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Choose the desired function</B> from the Alloc menu.
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Choose the desired amount of memory</B> that you want to allocate, free, or leave unallocated.
<BR><BR>For all functions, an n amount is available.&nbsp; Selecting this item closes the Allocation Information dialog box
and opens a separate dialog box displaying the following information:
<UL>
<LI>K Allocated (approx.)
<LI>K free (approx.)

<H1 ID="Spy"> Spy </H1>
<BR>Most Windows programs are message based.&nbsp; Messages are sent to windows that programs create and the programs are
expected to react to the messages appropriately.
<BR><BR>When a program does not react as expected, you must spend time debugging the program to find and correct the errors.
&nbsp;Spy is a tool designed to help you debug Windows programs by letting you view the messages sent to windows in Win16
and Win32 applications.&nbsp; By watching how a program reacts to the messages it receives, you can isolate the parts of your
code that are causing problems and then make the required corrections.
<BR><BR>With Spy:
<UL>
<LI>you can determine if your window is receiving the messages you expect it to receive.
<LI>you can verify that your window is receiving messages in the order you expect.
<LI>novice Windows programmers can become familiar with Windows messages, by viewing the messages and their parameters.
</UL>
<BR>As you run your Windows programs, Spy displays messages in the Spy window.&nbsp; You control the window using the menu
items or the Spy toolbar.

of these.&nbsp; Spy lets you limit the messages on which it will report so that you do not have to sort through all the extraneous
data yourself.
<BR><BR>Spy maintains two lists of messages:&nbsp; the messages to watch list and the messages to stop on list.&nbsp; When
spy monitors a message in the messages to watch list it adds information about that message to the Message List in the Spy
window.&nbsp; When spy monitors a message in the messages to stop on list it displays a message box reporting that the message
has been encountered and pauses spying operations until you restart them by selecting Continue Spying from the spy menu.&nbsp;
Any message that does not appear on either list is ignored by Spy
<BR><BR>To modify the messages to watch list choose Messages To Watch from the Messages menu.&nbsp; To modify the messages

<H3 ID="Saving_and_Loading_Message_Configurations"> Saving and Loading Message Configurations </H3>
<BR>Selecting messages to monitor can be an involved procedure because of the number of options available.&nbsp; Once selected,
the group of message selections is called a message configuration.
<BR><BR>Spy allows you to save message configurations and recall them again.&nbsp; This section describes the functions relating
to message configurations:
<UL>
<LI>Using the Auto Save Feature
<LI>Saving a Message Configuration
<LI>Loading a Message Configuration
</UL>
<H4 ID="Using_the_Auto_Save_Feature"> Using the Auto Save Feature </H4>
<BR>When the Auto Save Message Configuration feature is active Spy saves your message configuration each time you exit.&nbsp;
The next time you start Spy, the message configuration is automatically reloaded.
<BR><BR>To activate or deactivate this feature choose the Auto Save Message Configuration item from the Messages menu.&nbsp;
When this feature is active its menu item is checked.
<H4 ID="Saving_a_Message_Configuration"> Saving a Message Configuration </H4>
<BR>With Spy you can save your message configurations so you can easily load a previous message configuration instead of reselecting
the desired messages.
<BR><BR>To save a message configuration follow these procedures:
<DL>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Select the messages you want to monitor</B> as described in the sections entitled <A HREF="#Selecting_Message_Classes">Selecting Message Classes</A>
and <A HREF="#Selecting_Individual_Messages">Selecting Individual Messages</A>.
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Choose Save Message Configuration</B> from the Messages menu.
<BR><BR>This opens a Save As dialog box.
<DT>(3)
<DD><B> Specify the desired file name and path</B> for this message configuration.
<DT>(4)
<DD><B> Click on OK</B> in the Save As dialog box when completed.
<BR><BR>This saves the message configuration as specified and closes the dialog.
</DL>
<H4 ID="Loading_a_Message_Configuration"> Loading a Message Configuration </H4>
<BR>To load a previously saved message configuration, follow these procedures:
<DL>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Choose Load Message Configuration</B> from the Messages menu.
<BR><BR>The Open dialog box appears.
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Select the message configuration you previously saved.</B>
<DT>(3)
<DD><B> Click on OK.</B>
<BR><BR>The Open dialog box closes and Spy loads the selected message configuration.
</DL>
<H2 ID="Spying"> Spying </H2>
<BR>Once you have selected the messages you want Spy to monitor, you select windows for Spy to watch.&nbsp; This starts spying
operations.
<H3 ID="Start_Spying"> Start Spying </H3>
<BR>Message logging begins when you select a window to monitor.&nbsp; Spy monitors the selected window for the messages specified.
&nbsp;You can start spying by selecting one window to spy on, or choosing to spy on all windows.
<DL>
<DT>To spy on all windows:
<DD>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Choose All Windows</B> from the Spy menu.
<BR><BR>Spy begins immediately monitoring all windows for the specified messages.&nbsp; The caption bar specifies that you
are monitoring all windows.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>Note:
<DD>You can use the All Windows menu item at any time, not just to start spying.&nbsp; If you begin spying by choosing one window,
then want to monitor all windows, choose All Windows from the Spy menu.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>To spy on one window:
<DD>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Choose Select Window</B> from the Spy menu.
<BR><BR>This minimizes the Spy window and opens the Select Window dialog which prompts you to choose a window to monitor.
<BR><BR><TT><IMG SRC="spy8.bmp" ALIGN=MIDDLE></TT>

rests.</B>
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Position the cursor inside the icon in the dialog box.&nbsp; Press the mouse button and hold it down.</B>
<BR><BR>As you move the cursor across the screen, the window on which the cursor is positioned has a highlighted border and
information about the selected window appears in the dialog box.
<DT>(3)

you are monitoring.
</DL>
<H3 ID="Spying_on_More_Windows"> Spying on More Windows </H3>
<BR>Once you have started spying you can select additional windows to monitor, unless you chose All Windows to start the spy
process.&nbsp; You select additional windows in the same way you select one window.&nbsp; 
<DL>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Choose Add Window</B> from the Spy menu.
<BR><BR>This minimizes the Spy window and opens the Select Window dialog.
<DT>(2)

multiple windows.
</DL>
<H3 ID="Stop_Spying"> Stop Spying </H3>
<BR>Choose Done Spying from the Spy menu to stop spying on the selected windows.&nbsp; When you choose this item, Spy does
not retain the list of windows selected for spying.
<H3 ID="Pause_Spying"> Pause Spying </H3>
<BR>Choose Stop Spying Temporarily from the Spy menu to pause message logging.&nbsp; When you choose this item, Spy retains
the list of windows selected for spying.
<BR><BR>The Stop Spying Temporarily menu item changes to Continue Spying when the pause is active.&nbsp; Choose Continue Spying
from the Spy menu to start spying again.&nbsp; This starts spying and changes the menu item back to Stop Spying Temporarily.
<H2 ID="Viewing_Message_Information"> Viewing Message Information </H2>
<BR>Double clicking on a message in the message list reveals a Message Information dialog box which contains additional information
about the selected message.&nbsp; This dialog displays the message, the number of times it has been issued, and the window
that received the selected instance of the message.
<BR><BR><TT><IMG SRC="spy9.bmp" ALIGN=MIDDLE></TT>
<BR><B><I>Figure 159.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> The Message Information dialog box displays additional information about the

<H3 ID="Displaying_Help_for_the_Message"> Displaying Help for the Message </H3>
<BR>You can get more information about most messages, such as the meaning of their parameters, by the Help for Message button
on the Message Information dialog.&nbsp; This starts the Windows help facility to display the information.&nbsp; Help is not
available for all messages.
<H3 ID="Changing_the_Monitoring_State_of_the_Message"> Changing the Monitoring State of the Message </H3>
<BR>The watch and stop on check boxes in the Message Information dialog indicate if the message appears in the messages to
watch or messages to stop on lists.&nbsp; You can add the message to either of these lists by checking the appropriate check
box or remove it by removing the check.
<H3 ID="Highlighting_the_Receiving_Window"> Highlighting the Receiving Window </H3>
<BR>If the window that received this message has not been destroyed you can highlight it by selecting the Highlight Window
button.&nbsp; This changes the border color of the window so it is easy to locate.
<H3 ID="Displaying_Information_about_the_Receiving_Window"> Displaying Information about the Receiving Window </H3>
<BR>If the window that received this message has not been destroyed you can get additional information about it by selecting
the Show Information button.&nbsp; This opens a Window Information dialog that displays information such as the window's class,
style, size and position.&nbsp; For more information on the Window Information dialog see the section entitled <A HREF="#Viewing_Window_Information">Viewing Window Information</A>.
<H2 ID="Spy__Working_with_Log_Files"> Spy:&nbsp; Working with Log Files </H2>
<BR>By writing the information in the message list to a log file, you have a file you can look at in case a program you are
running terminates your applications.&nbsp; In such a situation, your message list is lost so you have no information to refer
to when debugging.&nbsp; Writing to a log file also allows you to print the output later or annotate the text file on-line.
<H3 ID="Spy__Configuring_the_Log_File"> Spy:&nbsp; Configuring the Log File </H3>
<BR>Choosing Configure Log from the File menu opens the Log Configuration dialog where you customize Spy's behaviour when
it logs to a file.&nbsp; This dialog contains four sections where you specify information.

<H4 ID="Spy__Default_Log_Name"> Spy:&nbsp; Default Log Name </H4>
<BR>In the Default Log Name field, specify the file to which Spy writes when you begin logging.&nbsp; Clicking the Browse
button next to this field opens a Choose Log Name dialog that lets you browse your file structure while choosing the log name.
<H4 ID="Spy__Log_Name"> Spy:&nbsp; Log Name </H4>
<BR>The settings in the Log Name section of the dialog indicate to Spy how the name of the log file should be determined when
the Log to File menu item is chosen.
<BR><BR>When the Query for Log Name option is selected, Spy presents a prompt each time you select Log to File from the File
menu or the toolbar.&nbsp; This reveals a Choose Log Name dialog where you specify the file to which Spy writes the log information.
<BR><BR>When the Use Default Log Name option is selected, Spy writes the log information to the file indicated in the Default
Log Name field in the Log Configuration dialog.&nbsp; No prompt appears.
<H4 ID="Spy__Action_When_Log_File_Exists"> Spy:&nbsp; Action When Log File Exists </H4>
<BR>The options in the Action When Log File Exists section of the Log Configuration dialog dictate how Spy behaves when you
choose Log to File and a log file already exists.

<H3 ID="Spy__Start_Logging"> Spy:&nbsp; Start Logging </H3>
<BR>Choosing Log to File from the File menu tells Spy to write all new information added to the message list to the log file.
&nbsp;Depending on the options selected in the Log Configuration dialog, the following dialogs may appear when you choose
Log to File:
<UL>
<LI>Choose Log Name dialog-On this dialog you specify the file to which Spy writes the log information.
<LI>Log Information dialog-On this dialog you choose a course of action for logging when the specified log file already exists.

<DL>
<DT>Note:
<DD>Choosing Cancel on either of these dialogs closes the dialog and prevents logging from starting.
</DL>
<H3 ID="Spy__Logging_Type"> Spy:&nbsp; Logging Type </H3>
<BR>There are two ways to write information to the log file:&nbsp; 
<UL>
<LI>Continuous Logging
<LI>Periodic Logging
</UL>
<BR>If the Continuous Logging option is activated, then as Spy writes information to the message list, it simultaneously writes
to a log file.
<BR><BR>When the Periodic Logging option is activated, Spy writes information to the log file only after a reasonable amount
of information, as determined by the application, has been recorded in the message list
<BR><BR>Periodic logging is more convenient because it is faster than continuous logging.&nbsp; However, if your system goes
down, some information will be lost.&nbsp; By simultaneously writing to the log file and the message list, continuous logging
allows you to store all information in a log file without the chance of losing information.
<H3 ID="Spy__Stop_Logging"> Spy:&nbsp; Stop Logging </H3>
<BR>Once the log is started, Spy continues writing to the log file until you stop logging.&nbsp; A check mark beside the Log
to File item in the File menu indicates that a log is being created.&nbsp; Choose this item again to stop logging.
<H3 ID="Spy__Pause_Logging"> Spy:&nbsp; Pause Logging </H3>
<BR>To temporarily stop writing information to the log file you can choose the Pause Log item from the File menu.&nbsp; A

various types of activity DDE Spy can monitor.
<DL>
<DT>Posted Messages
<DD>When the Posted Messages item is checked, DDE Spy makes an entry in the event list whenever a DDE message that has been selected
using the Message Filter dialog is posted to an application's message queue.
<DT>Sent Messages
<DD>When the Sent Messages item is checked, DDE Spy makes an entry in the event list whenever a DDE message that has been selected
using the Message Filter dialog is sent to an application.
<DT>String Handle Data
<DD>DDE applications use strings to communicate with other applications.&nbsp; These strings are registered with the operating
system by the applications using them.&nbsp; When done with the strings, the applications tell the operating system they are
done and the system destroys the strings.&nbsp; DDE Spy reports on all string operations that occur within the system when
the String Handle Data menu item is checked.
<DT>Callbacks
<DD>Callbacks are special functions called by the operating system to process DDE messages.&nbsp; When the Callback item is checked
DDE Spy makes an entry in the event list each time the operating system calls a DDE Callback for a transaction type that has
been selected using the Callback Filter dialog.
<DT>Errors
<DD>A DDE error usually indicates that a DDE operation has failed.&nbsp; When the Errors item is checked, DDE Spy reports all
DDE errors that occur within the system.
<DT>Conversations
<DD>A conversation is the connection established between two applications that is necessary to perform DDE operations.&nbsp; When
the Conversations item is checked, DDE Spy makes an entry in the event list each time a conversation is established or terminated.
<DT>Links
<DD>A link is a relationship between two DDE applications:&nbsp; a server and a client.&nbsp; A link is established for a single
value maintained by the server.&nbsp; When this value changes the server notifies the client.&nbsp; When the Links item is
checked, DDE Spy logs notifications in the event list each time a link is established or terminated.

<H1 ID="Win16__Dr__Watcom_for_Windows_3_1"> Win16:&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom for Windows 3.1 </H1>
<BR><BR>The 16-bit version of Dr.&nbsp; Watcom is a post-mortem debugger for Windows 3.1.&nbsp; When an exception occurs in
a program, a post-mortem debugger allows you, after the fact, to examine the state of both the program and the system in order
to determine the cause of the exception.&nbsp; In addition to being a debugging tool, Dr.&nbsp; Watcom is a system utility
that enables you to examine task information.
<BR><BR>Dr.&nbsp; Watcom can be a useful tool when performing in-house testing on your applications.&nbsp; By running Dr.
&nbsp;Watcom while testing applications, all faults are logged.&nbsp; This gives you important information to recreate the
errors so you can fix the problems.
<DL>
<DT>Note:
<DD>Use the 16-bit version of Dr.&nbsp; Watcom to monitor 16-bit Windows (Win16) applications running under Windows 3.1 or Win32
based operating systems.&nbsp; Use the 32-bit version of Dr.&nbsp; Watcom to monitor Win32 applications running under Win32
based operating systems.

<H2 ID="Win16__Using_Dr__Watcom"> Win16:&nbsp; Using Dr.&nbsp; Watcom </H2>
<BR>This section discusses the following topics:
<UL>
<LI>Starting Dr.&nbsp; Watcom
<LI>Quitting Dr.&nbsp; Watcom
<LI>The Dr.&nbsp; Watcom Menu Bar
</UL>
<BR>Dr.&nbsp; Watcom is designed to be used effectively while minimized.&nbsp; You only need to view the application window
when an error or warning occurs.&nbsp; When this happens the Dr.&nbsp; Watcom icon changes from stethoscope to an explosion
indicating that information is waiting for your attention in the main window.
<BR><BR>Some of Dr.&nbsp; Watcom's main functionality can also be accessed using the system menu while the application is
minimized.&nbsp; This includes the log options, task control, and log current state functions.
<BR><BR>Dr.&nbsp; Watcom is more useful with the Windows debug kernel.&nbsp; Under the debug kernel, Windows checks for many
common programming errors and generates debugging messages when it finds them.&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom catches the debugging
messages and displays them on the event list.&nbsp; Viewing these messages helps you identify errors in your program that
you might not otherwise see.
<H3 ID="Win16__Starting_Dr__Watcom"> Win16:&nbsp; Starting Dr.&nbsp; Watcom </H3>
<BR>To start Dr.&nbsp; Watcom, double click on the Dr.&nbsp; Watcom icon.&nbsp; This opens the Dr.&nbsp; Watcom window.

<H2 ID="Win16__Using_the_Dr__Watcom_Window"> Win16:&nbsp; Using the Dr.&nbsp; Watcom Window </H2>
<BR>When you open Dr.&nbsp; Watcom, a window appears which contains the event list.&nbsp; The event list records the various
events occurring under Windows.&nbsp; Some examples of events are errors, debugging messages (under the debug kernel of Windows
only), the starting and ending of programs, and the loading and unloading of DLLs.

<BR><B><I>Figure 178.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> The Dr.&nbsp; Watcom window contains the event list which records and displays
events occurring under Windows.</B>
<BR><BR>When a debug message is issued, the Dr.&nbsp; Watcom icon alerts you that an entry has been made on the event list.
&nbsp;The Dr.&nbsp; Watcom icon changes from stethoscope to an explosion.&nbsp; To reset the icon you must acknowledge the
alert in one of two ways:
<DL>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> View the event list</B> by double clicking on the icon, or
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Choose Clear Alert</B> from the system menu.
</DL>
<BR>Dr.&nbsp; Watcom intercepts all exceptions that occur in the system.&nbsp; An exception is an error that causes your program
to terminate.&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom prevents your program from terminating by halting the program's execution.&nbsp; The
state of the program remains intact.
<BR><BR>As with non-fatal errors, Dr.&nbsp; Watcom makes an entry on the event list when an exception occurs.&nbsp; However,
instead of alerting you to the entry by changing the icon, Dr.&nbsp; Watcom reveals an exception dialog.&nbsp; This dialog
gives you several options.&nbsp; Refer to the section entitled <A HREF="#Win16__Dr__Watcom__Exception_Handling">Win16:&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom:&nbsp; Exception Handling</A>

<H3 ID="Win16__Setting_the_Alert_Feature"> Win16:&nbsp; Setting the Alert Feature </H3>
<BR>Each time Dr.&nbsp; Watcom logs a debug message, its icon changes from a stethoscope to an explosion .&nbsp; This indicates
that there is important information waiting for you in the event list.&nbsp; Some debug messages report only minor programming
anomalies that may not be errors at all.&nbsp; The text for these messages is prefixed by<B> wn,</B> for warning.&nbsp; Because
these messages are not urgent, you may not want the icon to signal the message.&nbsp; The Alert on Warnings menu item allows
you to configure Dr.&nbsp; Watcom so that its icon does not change for these minor warning messages.
<BR><BR>When the Alert on Warnings item in the File menu is not checked, the icon does not change for minor warning messages.
&nbsp;When this item is checked, the Dr.&nbsp; Watcom icon alerts you when a warning or serious error occurs.
<H3 ID="Win16__Showing_the_DIP_status"> Win16:&nbsp; Showing the DIP status </H3>
<BR>DIP's (Debugging Information Processors) are Dynamic Link Libraries that Dr.&nbsp; Watcom loads to read debugging information.
&nbsp;Each DIP allows Dr.&nbsp; Watcom to read a different type of debugging information.&nbsp; Choosing the Show DIP Status
item from the File menu displays the Debugging Information Processor Status dialog.

<BR><BR>Instead of terminating the program, Dr.&nbsp; Watcom suspends it and leaves its state intact.&nbsp; Because the state
is undisturbed you can view the program's state information from the exception dialog, including memory and register values.
&nbsp;The exception dialog displays information about error and gives you several options.&nbsp; The information displayed
about the error includes:
<DL>
<DT>Task Name
<DD>The name of the module in which the error occurred.
<DT>Task Path
<DD>The full path of the file from which the offending module was loaded.
<DT>Fault Type
<DD>The type of fault that occurred.
<DT>Fault CS:EIP
<DD>The address of the instruction being executed when the fault occurred.
<DT>Source Info
<DD>The source line on which the error occurred.&nbsp; This only appears if the program running contains debugging information.
</DL>
<BR>There are four buttons on the exception dialog that you can use to proceed.
<DL>
<DT>Act
<DD>When the act button is pressed, Dr.&nbsp; Watcom's action is determined by the option currently selected in the action to
take section of the dialog.&nbsp; The following describes the action taken for each option.
<DL>
<DT>Terminate Task
<DD>When the Terminate Task radio button is selected choosing Act causes the faulting task to be terminated immediately.
<DT>Restart Instruction
<DD>When the Restart Instruction radio button is selected choosing Act causes the faulting task to restart execution starting
with the instruction pointed to by its CS:EIP.&nbsp; This option is primarily used to restart a task after you have changed
its register values using the Task Status dialog.
<DT>Chain to Next Handler
<DD>A handler is a piece of code, a program, or a routine that gets called when an exception occurs.&nbsp; The system can have
several exception handlers.&nbsp; When the Chain to Next Handler radio button is selected choosing Act passes the exception
on to the next handler in the sequence, or chain.
</DL>
<DT>Act and Log
<DD>Choosing the Act and Log button first creates a log file entry recording information about this fault then takes the same
action that would result from choosing the Act button.
<DT>Registers
<DD>Select the Registers button to open the Task Status dialog.&nbsp; This dialog gives you additional information on the state
of the program when it crashed.&nbsp; From this window you can change the registers and flags, view segment mappings, and
do a stack trace.&nbsp; Refer to the section entitled <A HREF="#Win16__Examining_the_Task_Status">Win16:&nbsp; Examining the Task Status</A>

<BR><BR>This dialog displays information in four sections:
<UL>
<LI>Source Information
<LI>Registers
<LI>Flags
<LI>Instructions Around Fault
</UL>
<BR>The Source Information section indicates the source file where the error occurred and the line of that source file.&nbsp;
In order to get source information, your program must have debugging information.&nbsp; N/A appears in the Source Information
section if the program does not contain debugging information or the exception occurred on an assembly instruction that does
not correspond to a source file.
<BR><BR>The Registers and Flags sections display information in the CPU at the time of the exception.
<BR><BR>The Instructions Around Fault section displays the assembly instructions surrounding the instruction that was being
executed when the fault occurred.&nbsp; An asterisk marks the instruction to which the CS:EIP is currently pointing.
<BR><BR>When the Show Symbols box is checked, Dr.&nbsp; Watcom tries to replace addresses in the assembly code with symbolic
names.&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom can only replace addresses if the faulting module contained debugging information.&nbsp; If
this box is not checked, addresses are left as numeric values.
<H4 ID="Win16__Dr__Watcom__Changing_the_Registers"> Win16:&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom:&nbsp; Changing the Registers </H4>
<BR>In the Task Status dialog you can set up testing and debugging situations by changing the register and flag values.&nbsp;
To change a register value simply enter a new value in the edit field that contains the current register value.&nbsp; To change
the state of a flag register just check or uncheck the check box associated with that flag.&nbsp; A flag has a value of 1

<BR><B><I>Figure 184.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> The Segment Map dialog lists the selectors to which the segments were mapped.</B>
<BR><BR>This dialog allows you to view the data contained in each of your program's segments.&nbsp; To view this memory, double
click on the desired segment.&nbsp; This opens a Memory Display window for the selected segment.
<BR><BR><TT><IMG SRC="drw8.bmp" ALIGN=MIDDLE></TT>
<BR><B><I>Figure 185.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> The Memory Display window displays the memory stored in the selected segment.</B>
<BR><BR>The Memory Display window displays all of the data stored in the selected segment.&nbsp; This information appears
in hexadecimal form.&nbsp; This allows you to see if the data in memory is what you believe it should be.
<BR><BR>There are a number of functions you can perform in the Memory Display window.&nbsp; Following is a description of
these functions.
<BR><BR></TT><B>Dr. Watcom: Saving Window Information</B></TT>
<BR>The Save items in the File menu of the Memory Display window allow you to save the current window information to a text
file.&nbsp; Choosing Save from the File menu in the Memory Display window saves the data in the window into the current working
directory.&nbsp; A message box appears indicating the path to which Dr.&nbsp; Watcom saved the file.
<BR><BR>Choosing Save As from the File menu allows you to specify the file to which you want to save the information currently
in the window.&nbsp; This opens a Save As dialog box where you select the desired file.&nbsp; Click on OK when completed.
&nbsp;A message box appears indicating the path to which Dr.&nbsp; Watcom saved the file.
<BR><BR></TT><B>Dr. Watcom: Changing the Display</B></TT>
<BR>There are five ways to display the information on the Memory Display window.&nbsp; You can display the information as:
<UL>
<LI>Bytes
<LI>Words
<LI>DWords
<LI>16 Bit Code
<LI>32 Bit Code
</UL>
<BR>To change the form of the displayed data, select an item from the Display menu.&nbsp; When displaying data in bytes, the
data appears in the window as it physically appears in memory.&nbsp; When the data is displayed as words, the bytes in memory
are interpreted for you so that the values displayed are those that would be obtained by treating the memory as an array of
words.&nbsp; For example, if memory containing the values:
<BR><BR>12 34 56 78 9A BC DE FF
<BR><BR>was shown as words, the memory window would display:
<BR><BR>3412 7856 BC9A FFDE
<BR><BR>A similar interpretation is performed when the data is displayed as DWords.&nbsp; If the above memory was shown as
DWords, the memory window would display:
<BR><BR>78563412 FFDEBC9A
<BR><BR>This rearrangement of bytes does not affect the textual interpretation of the data shown on the right hand side of
the window.
<BR><BR>Selecting 16 or 32 Bit Code from the Display menu presents the data in a disassembled form.&nbsp; Sometimes presenting
the data in disassembled form is not accurate.&nbsp; This is because when Dr.&nbsp; Watcom disassembles the data it begins
at the first byte of the memory block and disassembles it linearly.&nbsp; If a byte in this block, such as a padding byte,
throws off the sequence, the disassembly will be meaningless.
<BR><BR></TT><B>Dr. Watcom: Setting the Offset</B></TT>
<BR>On the Memory Display window you can set the offset.&nbsp; This means that you can reposition the data so that the specified
line appears at the top of the window.&nbsp; The offset you enter appears on the first line.&nbsp; It will not necessarily
be the first piece of information because rounding often occurs to avoid breaking a line.
<DL>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Choose Set Offset</B> from the menu bar on the Memory Display window.
<BR><BR>This opens a Goto Offset dialog box.
<BR><BR><TT><IMG SRC="drw9.bmp" ALIGN=MIDDLE></TT>
<BR><B><I>Figure 186.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> In the Goto Offset dialog, enter the offset you want to appears at the top
of the Memory Display window.</B>
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Enter the desired offset</B> that you want to position at the top of the Memory Display window.&nbsp; You can enter the
offset in decimal or hexadecimal form.&nbsp; However, you must prefix hexadecimal values with 0x.
<DT>(3)
<DD><B> Click on OK.</B>
<BR><BR>This closes the dialog and positions the data as requested.
</DL>
<BR></TT><B>Dr. Watcom: The Handle Information Dialog Box</B></TT>
<BR>A Handle Information dialog box attached to the Memory Display window provides the following information:
<UL>
<LI>Block Address
<LI>Block Handle
<LI>Block Size
<LI>Lock Count
<LI>Page Lock Count
</UL>
<BR><TT><IMG SRC="drw10.bmp" ALIGN=MIDDLE></TT>
<BR><B><I>Figure 187.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> The Handle Information dialog box displays information about the memory object
displayed in the Memory Display Window.</B>

<H4 ID="Win16__Performing_a_Stack_Trace"> Win16:&nbsp; Performing a Stack Trace </H4>
<BR>A program is made up of a series of functions.&nbsp; A function executes when it is called by the operating system or
another function.&nbsp; When completed it returns to the point in the code from which it was called.
<BR><BR>Whenever a function is called, a stack frame is pushed onto the stack.&nbsp; When the function returns, the stack
frame is popped from the stack.&nbsp; The stack frame contains information about the point from which the function was called
and to which it will return.&nbsp; The collection of stack frames currently on the stack is called a call chain.
<BR><BR>The stack trace function lets you walk the call chain.&nbsp; This allows you to determine where each function in the
call chain was called from and where it will return to.&nbsp; To perform a stack trace, click on the Stack Trace button in
the Task Status dialog to reveal the Stack Trace dialog.

<BR><B><I>Figure 188.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> The Stack Trace dialog allows you to walk the call chain.</B>
<BR><BR>When the Stack Trace dialog opens, it contains information from the stack frame for the function that was executing
at the time of the fault.&nbsp; The Instructions Around Fault section displays the assembly instructions around the call to
the faulting function.&nbsp; The instruction directly after the call to the faulting function is marked with an asterisk.
&nbsp;Other information includes the address of this instruction (CS:IP) and the base stack pointer (SS:BP) at the time of
the call.&nbsp; If the faulting module contained debugging information and the marked assembly instruction corresponds to
a source line, then source file information appears.
<BR><BR>Selecting the Next button displays information from the next oldest stack frame.&nbsp; This is information about the
point from which the currently displayed function was called.&nbsp; If the currently displayed function was called by the
operating system, then the message &quot;No more stack frames!&quot; appears because there are no stack frames for calls made
from the operating system.
<BR><BR>Selecting the Prev button displays information from the next most recent stack frame.&nbsp; This moves you in the
opposite direction along the call chain as pressing the Next button.
<BR><BR>The Cancel button closes the window.

<BR><BR></TT><B>Dr. Watcom: Saving Window Information</B></TT>
<BR>The Save items in the File menu on the Memory Range window allows you to save the currently displayed information to a
text file.&nbsp; Choosing Save from the File menu on the Memory Range window saves the data in the window into the current
working directory.&nbsp; A message box appears indicating the path to which Dr.&nbsp; Watcom saved the file.&nbsp; 
<BR><BR>Choosing Save As from the File menu allows you to specify the file to which you want to save the data currently in
the window.&nbsp; This opens a Save As dialog box where you select the desired file.&nbsp; Click on OK when completed.&nbsp;
A message box appears indicating the path to which Dr.&nbsp; Watcom saved the file.
<BR><BR></TT><B>Dr. Watcom: Changing the Display</B></TT>
<BR>There are three ways to display the information in the Memory Range window.&nbsp; You can display the information as:
<UL>
<LI>Bytes
<LI>Words
<LI>DWords
</UL>
<BR>To change the form of the displayed data, select an item from the Display menu.&nbsp; When displaying data in bytes, the
data appears in the window as it physically appears in memory.&nbsp; When the data is displayed as words, the bytes in memory
are interpreted for you so that the values displayed are those that would be obtained by treating the memory as an array of
words.&nbsp; For example, if memory containing the values:
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12 34 56 78 9A BC DE FF</TT>
<BR><BR>was shown as words, the memory window would display:
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3412 7856 BC9A FFDE</TT>
<BR><BR>A similar interpretation is performed when the data is displayed as DWords.&nbsp; If the above memory was shown as
DWords, the memory window would display:
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 78563412 FFDEBC9A</TT>
<BR><BR>This rearrangement of bytes does not affect the textual interpretation of the data shown on the right hand side of
the window.
<BR><BR></TT><B>Dr. Watcom: Setting the Offset</B></TT>
<BR>In the Memory Range window you can set the offset.&nbsp; This means that you can reposition the data so that specific
information appears at the top of the window.&nbsp; The offset you enter appears on the first line.&nbsp; It will not necessarily
be the first piece of information because rounding often occurs to avoid breaking a line.&nbsp; 
<DL>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Choose Set Offset</B> from the menu bar on the Memory Display window.
<BR><BR>This opens a Goto Offset dialog box.
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Enter the desired offset</B> that you want to position at the top of the Memory Range window.&nbsp; You can enter the
offset in decimal or hexadecimal form.&nbsp; However, you must prefix hexadecimal values with 0x.
<DT>(3)
<DD><B> Click on OK.</B>&nbsp; This closes the dialog and positions the data as requested.
</DL>
<BR><TT><IMG SRC="drw9.bmp" ALIGN=MIDDLE></TT>

<H4 ID="Win32__Dr__Watcom__Specifying_the_Log_File_Data"> Win32:&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom:&nbsp; Specifying the Log File Data </H4>
<BR>In the Log File Data and Disassembly Options sections of the Log Options dialog, you select the information you want to
appear in the log file.&nbsp; The Log File Data section lists the various types of information that can be included in a log
file.&nbsp; If the check box for a piece of information is marked then that type of information will be written to the log
file.&nbsp; The options in this section are:
<DL>
<DT>Memory Dump
<DD>When this box is checked, a Memory Dump dialog is displayed whenever a log file entry is made.&nbsp; This dialog allows you
to select the regions of memory you want to dump into the log file and is discussed in the section entitled <A HREF="#Win32__Creating_A_Log_File_Entry">Win32:&nbsp; Creating A Log File Entry</A>.
<BR><BR>This option only affects log file entries created because of an exception.
<DT>Query for notes
<DD>When this box is checked, an Annotate Log dialog is displayed whenever a log file entry is made.&nbsp; This dialog lets you
enter text to be included in the log file entry.&nbsp; The Annotate Log dialog is discussed in the section entitled <A HREF="#Win32__Creating_A_Log_File_Entry">Win32:&nbsp; Creating A Log File Entry</A>.
<DT>Loaded modules
<DD>When this box is checked, each log file entry includes a list of all modules loaded for each process running in the system.
<DT>Current Processes
<DD>When this box is checked, each log file entry includes a list of all processes currently running in the system, including
information about each process.
<DT>Mem Manager Info
<DD>When this box is checked, log file entries will include summary information on the memory usage of the process that caused
the exception.&nbsp; This option affects only log file entries created because of an exception.
</DL>
<BR>The fields in the Disassembly Options section relate to the disassembly section appearing in the log file.&nbsp; These
fields affect only log file entries made because of exceptions.
<UL>
<LI>The value in the Disasm Backup field tells Dr.&nbsp; Watcom the number of instructions before the fault you want written
to the log file.
<LI>The value in the Disasm Lines field tells Dr.&nbsp; Watcom the total number of instructions you want it to show in the
log file.&nbsp; This value includes the instructions displayed before the fault.
</UL>
<H4 ID="Win32__Dr__Watcom__Other_Options"> Win32:&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom:&nbsp; Other Options </H4>
<BR>When the Auto Log option is selected, Dr.&nbsp; Watcom creates a log file when an exception occurs and then terminates
the application instead of revealing the exception dialog.
<BR><BR>The Max Log File Size option allows you to set the maximum size in bytes for a log file.&nbsp; When the log file exceeds
this size, Dr.&nbsp; Watcom prompts you with a message box when you start the application.
<BR><BR><TT><IMG SRC="drw14.bmp" ALIGN=MIDDLE></TT>
<BR><B><I>Figure 201.</I></B><B><I></I></B><B> A message box prompts you to erase the log file when it becomes larger than
the maximum log file size specified on the Log File Options dialog.</B>
<BR><BR>This message box offers you the opportunity to delete your log file before it becomes uncontrollably large.
<H2 ID="Win32__Attaching_Processes_to_Dr__Watcom"> Win32:&nbsp; Attaching Processes to Dr.&nbsp; Watcom </H2>
<BR>Attaching processes to Dr.&nbsp; Watcom enables it to monitor events that occur within the processes.&nbsp; When processes
are attached, Dr.&nbsp; Watcom reports on events that occur within your process, such as DLL loads, thread creations, and
thread terminations.&nbsp; Attaching also allows Dr.&nbsp; Watcom to detect exceptions in your process.
<BR><BR>There are four ways to attach processes to Dr.&nbsp; Watcom:
<UL>
<LI>Command line
<LI>Add New process menu item
<LI>Auto Add Process feature
<LI>Process Control dialog
</UL>
<BR>Dr.&nbsp; Watcom cannot detach from processes to which it is attached.&nbsp; The attachment exists until the process terminates.
&nbsp;If you try to close Dr.&nbsp; Watcom while it is attached to processes, a warning box appears listing the processes
to which Dr.&nbsp; Watcom is still attached.
<BR><BR>Select Yes or No to continue.
<H3 ID="Win32__Command_Line"> Win32:&nbsp; Command Line </H3>
<BR>You can run a program and attach Dr.&nbsp; Watcom to it at start-up by passing the path of the executable to Dr.&nbsp;
Watcom as a command line parameter.&nbsp; For example, to run the program<TT> foo.exe</TT> and attach Dr.&nbsp; Watcom to
it, type:
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drwatcom foo.exe</TT>
<BR><BR>If you often want to run a certain program with Dr.&nbsp; Watcom attached to it then you can create a Program Manager
icon that runs Dr.&nbsp; Watcom with the name of the program as a command line parameter.
<BR><BR>Double clicking on the icon when Dr.&nbsp; Watcom is not running causes Dr.&nbsp; Watcom to start-up.&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp;
Watcom then starts the specified process and attaches to it immediately.
<BR><BR>Double clicking on the icon when there is already an instance of Dr.&nbsp; Watcom running causes the existing instance
of Dr.&nbsp; Watcom to run the specified process and attach to it.&nbsp; The second Dr.&nbsp; Watcom terminates immediately
so that only one instance of Dr.&nbsp; Watcom is left running.
<H3 ID="Win32__Add_New_Process"> Win32:&nbsp; Add New Process </H3>
<BR>The Add New Process item in the Process menu is another way to start a new process and attach to it immediately.
<DL>
<DT>To start a new process using this item:
<DD>
<DT>(1)
<DD><B> Choose Add New Process</B> from the Process menu.
<BR><BR>This opens the Load Process dialog where you browse the file structure.
<DT>(2)
<DD><B> Select the program</B> you want to start with Dr.&nbsp; Watcom attached.
<DT>(3)
<DD><B> Click on OK.</B>
<BR><BR>This runs the selected program and attaches to it immediately.
</DL>
<H3 ID="Win32__Auto_Add_Processes"> Win32:&nbsp; Auto Add Processes </H3>
<BR>Checking the Auto Add Process item in the Process menu tells Dr.&nbsp; Watcom to attach to all new processes that start
in the system.&nbsp; When you activate this feature, Dr.&nbsp; Watcom checks the system every few seconds for new processes.
&nbsp;When it finds them, it attaches to them.&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom will not automatically attach to processes that began
before the Auto Add Process item was checked.
<BR><BR>The disadvantage of this feature is that in the few seconds between Dr.&nbsp; Watcom's process checks, your process
can start-up, run, and possibly cause an exception.&nbsp; When this occurs, a system dialog box appears reporting the error.
&nbsp;Selecting OK on this dialog immediately may not allow Dr.&nbsp; Watcom sufficient time to attach to the faulting process.
&nbsp;Wait for a few seconds and select the OK button on this dialog.&nbsp; The dialog closes and Dr.&nbsp; Watcom attaches
to the faulting process.&nbsp; The Dr.&nbsp; Watcom exception dialog then appears and you can proceed as usual.
<DL>
<DT>Note:
<DD>Occasionally, when this feature is active a message box may appear saying, &quot;An unexpected failure occurred while processing
a DebugActiveProcess API request.&nbsp; You may choose OK to terminate the process or Cancel to ignore the error&quot;.&nbsp;
This message results from a known limitation in Win32.&nbsp; If it appears simply choose Cancel.
</DL>
<H3 ID="Win32__Process_Control"> Win32:&nbsp; Process Control </H3>

that Dr.&nbsp; Watcom is currently attached to it.
</DL>
<H2 ID="Win32__Performing_Process_Control"> Win32:&nbsp; Performing Process Control </H2>
<BR>Selecting Process Control from the process menu or the system menu opens the Process Control dialog.&nbsp; This dialog
lists all processes currently running under Windows.&nbsp; Any process to which Dr.&nbsp; Watcom is attached is marked with
an asterisk.&nbsp; When you select a process by clicking on it, the Selected Process section of the dialog displays its Process
ID, Name, and Priority.
<BR><BR>The Refresh button on this dialog updates the displayed process information.
<BR><BR>From this dialog you can perform several functions.&nbsp; This section describes each function.
<DL>
<DT>Important:
