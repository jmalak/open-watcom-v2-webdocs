<H1 ID="Introduction_to_Open_Watcom_FORTRAN_77"> Introduction to Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 </H1>
<BR>Welcome to the Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 2.0 development system.&nbsp; Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 is an Open Source successor
to commercial compilers previously marketed by Sybase, Powersoft and originally WATCOM International Corp.
<BR><BR>Version 2.0 of Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 is a professional, optimizing, multi-platform FORTRAN 77 compiler with a comprehensive
suite of development tools for developing and debugging both 16-bit and 32-bit applications for DOS, extended DOS, Novell
NLMs, 16-bit OS/2, 32-bit OS/2, Windows 3.x, Windows 95/98/Me, Win32s, and Windows NT/2000/XP (Win32).
<BR><BR>You should read the entire contents of this booklet, as it contains information on new programs and modifications
that have been made since the previous release.
<HR>
<BR><B>Special NOTE to users of previous versions!&nbsp; See the section entitled</B> <A HREF="#Release_Notes_for_Open_Watcom_FORTRAN_77_2_0">Release Notes for Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 2.0</A><B>
to determine if you need to recompile your application.</B>
<HR>
<H2 ID="What_is_in_version_2_0_of_Open_Watcom_FORTRAN_77_"> What is in version 2.0 of Open Watcom FORTRAN 77? </H2>
<BR>Version 2.0 incorporates the features professional developers have been demanding:
<DL>
<DT>Open, Multi-target Integrated Development Environment
<DD>The IDE allows you to easily edit, compile, link, debug and build applications for 16-bit systems like DOS, OS/2 1.x, and
Windows 3.x and 32-bit systems like extended DOS, Novell NLMs, OS/2, Windows 3.x (Win32s), Windows 95/98/Me, and Windows NT/2000/XP.
&nbsp;Projects can be made up of multiple targets which permit a project to include EXEs and DLLs.&nbsp; The IDE produces
makefiles for the project which can be viewed and edited with a text editor.&nbsp; The IDE is hosted under Windows 3.x, Windows
95/98/Me, Windows NT/2000/XP, and 32-bit OS/2.

today's popular 32-bit operating systems, including Windows 95/98/Me, Windows NT/2000/XP, and OS/2.&nbsp; Cross-platform support
allows you to develop on a host development environment for execution on a different target system.
<DT>Multi-Platform Debugger
<DD>The new debugger advances developer productivity.&nbsp; New features include redesigned interface, ability to set breakpoints
on nested function calls, improved C++ and DLL debugging, reverse execution, and configurable interface.&nbsp; Graphical versions
of the debugger are available under Windows 3.x, Windows 95/98/Me, Windows NT/2000/XP, and 32-bit OS/2.&nbsp; Character versions
of the debugger are available under DOS, Windows 3.x, Windows NT/2000/XP, and 32-bit OS/2.&nbsp; For VIDEO fans, we have kept
the command line compatibility from the original debugger.
<DT>Performance Analysis
<DD>The Open Watcom Execution Sampler and Open Watcom Execution Profiler are performance analysis tools that locate heavily used
sections of code so that you may focus your efforts on these areas and improve your application's performance.
<DT>Editor

and Windows NT/2000/XP applications.&nbsp; The development tools include:
<DL>
<DT>Resource Editors
<DD>Enable you to create resources for your 16-bit and 32-bit Windows applications.&nbsp; For 32-bit OS/2 PM development, Open
Watcom FORTRAN 77 interoperates with IBM's OS/2 Developer's Toolkit (available from IBM).&nbsp; These tools have been seamlessly
integrated into the IDE.&nbsp; The resource compiler allows you to incorporate these resources into your application.
<DT>Resource Compiler
<DD>Produces a compiled resource file from a source file.
<DT>Zoom
<DD>Magnifies selected sections of your screen.
<DT>Heap Walker
<DD>Displays memory usage for testing and debugging purposes.

<DT>Dr.&nbsp; Watcom
<DD>Enables you to debug your program by examining both the program and the system after an exception occurs; monitors native
applications running under Windows 3.x, Windows 95/98/Me or Windows NT/2000/XP.
</DL>
<DT>Assembler
<DD>An assembler is included in the package.&nbsp; It is compatible with a subset of the Microsoft macro assembler (MASM).
<DT>Royalty-free 32-bit DOS Extender
<DD>Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 includes the DOS/4GW 32-bit DOS extender by Tenberry Software with royalty-free run-time and virtual
memory support up to 32MB.
<DT>Support for wide range of DOS Extenders
<DD>Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 allows you to develop and debug applications based on the following DOS extender technology:&nbsp;
CauseWay DOS Extender, Tenberry Software's DOS/4G and Phar Lap's TNT DOS Extender.&nbsp; You can also develop applications
using DOS/32A and FlashTek's DOS Extender but, currently, there is no support for debugging these applications.

<H2 ID="The_README_File"> The README File </H2>
<BR>Before you install Open Watcom FORTRAN 77, you should read the contents of the &quot;README&quot; file which is stored
in the root directory of the CD-ROM.&nbsp; It contains valuable, up-to-date information concerning this product.
<H2 ID="Installing_Open_Watcom_FORTRAN_77"> Installing Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 </H2>
<BR>The installation program in this version has been completely redesigned with several new &quot;smart&quot; features.&nbsp;
If you have installed a previous version of Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 then you should install Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 2.0 into
the same path (except for the reason described in the following paragraph).&nbsp; It will examine a previous installation
to determine what features were previously installed.&nbsp; It will use this information to establish default settings for
the installation that you are about to attempt.&nbsp; Of course, you can add or remove features as you progress through the
installation steps.
<BR><BR>If you are installing only one of the Open Watcom C/C++ or Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 products and you have an older version
of the other product, we do NOT recommend that you install the new product into the same directory as the old product.&nbsp;
The Open Watcom C/C++ and Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 products are compatible at the same version number.&nbsp; However, the Open
Watcom C/C++ and Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 products are usually NOT compatible across different version numbers.&nbsp; If this
is the case, care must be exercised when switching between use of the two products.&nbsp; Environment variables such as<B>
PATH</B> and<B> WATCOM</B> must be modified and/or corrected.&nbsp; System files such as<TT> CONFIG.SYS</TT> and<TT> SYSTEM.INI</TT>
must be modified and/or corrected.
<BR><BR>If you are installing both Open Watcom C/C++ 2.0 and Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 2.0, we recommend that you install both
products under the same directory.&nbsp; This will eliminate duplication of files and, as a result, reduce the total required
disk space.&nbsp; The two products share the use of certain environment variables which point to the installation directory.
&nbsp;If separate installation directories are used, problems will arise.
<BR><BR>When you install Open Watcom C/C++ and Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 in the same directory, you should not deselect any options
when running the second installation; otherwise the second product's install may remove files that were installed (and are
required) by the first product's install.&nbsp; This isn't an issue if you only have one of Open Watcom C/C++ or Open Watcom
FORTRAN 77.&nbsp; The problem is that Open Watcom C/C++ and Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 don't know about the installation options
you have selected for each other's product.
<BR><BR>If you wish to create a backup of your previous version, please do so before installing Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 2.0.
<BR><BR>If you decide to install Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 2.0 into a different directory than the previously installed version,
you will have to manually edit system files (e.g., CONFIG.SYS, AUTOEXEC.BAT, SYSTEM.INI) after the installation process is
complete to remove the old version from various environment variables (e.g., PATH, DEVICE=).&nbsp; This is necessary since
the path to the new version will appear after the path to the old version.&nbsp; To avoid this extra work, we recommend installing
the new version into the same path as the old version.
<BR><BR>As an example, here are a few of the environment variables and &quot;RUN&quot; directives that are modified/added
to the OS/2<TT> CONFIG.SYS</TT> file.&nbsp; You should make sure that all references to the older version of the software
are removed.
<BR><BR><B>Example:</B>
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LIBPATH=...;D:\WATCOM\BINP\DLL;...</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SET PATH=...;D:\WATCOM\BINP;D:\WATCOM\BINW;...</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SET HELP=...;D:\WATCOM\BINP\HELP;...</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SET BOOKSHELF=...;D:\WATCOM\BINP\HELP;...</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SET INCLUDE=...;D:\WATCOM\H\OS2;D:\WATCOM\H;</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SET WATCOM=D:\WATCOM</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SET EDPATH=D:\WATCOM\EDDAT</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RUN=D:\WATCOM\BINP\NMPBIND.EXE</TT>
<BR><BR>You may wish to run Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 under more than one operating system on the same personal computer.&nbsp;
For every operating system that you use, simply start up the operating system and run the corresponding install procedure.
<BR><BR>If you run the Windows 3.x installation procedure, you do not need to run the DOS installation procedure also.
<BR><BR>If you plan to use Win-OS/2 as a development platform under OS/2, you must run the Windows 3.1 install program (selecting
Windows 3.1 host support).
<BR><BR>Place the CD-ROM disk in your CD-ROM drive.&nbsp; Select one of the following procedures depending on the host operating
system that you are currently running.&nbsp; Below, substitute the CD-ROM drive specification for &quot;x:&quot;.

<H2 ID="Incremental_Installation"> Incremental Installation </H2>
<BR>You may wish to install Open Watcom FORTRAN 77, and subsequently install features that you omitted in the first install.
&nbsp;You can also remove features that you no longer wish to have installed.&nbsp; You can achieve this as follows:
<OL>
<LI>Start the installation program.
<LI>Select any new features that you wish to install.
<LI>Deselect any features that you wish to remove.
<LI>Re-run the installation program for each host operating system that you use.

<BR>Let's get started and introduce some of the tools that are in Open Watcom FORTRAN 77.&nbsp; The purpose of this chapter
is to briefly test out the new graphical tools in Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 using an existing application.
<BR><BR>In this tutorial, we will take an existing set of FORTRAN 77 source files, create a project in our integrated development
environment, and perform the following tasks:
<UL>
<LI>Add multiple targets
<LI>Make a target
<LI>Make all targets
<LI>Execute the program
<LI>Debug the program
<LI>Correct errors
<LI>Sample and profile the executable

<H2 ID="Outline"> Outline </H2>
<BR>Open Watcom's Integrated Development Environment (IDE) manages the files and tools that a programmer uses when developing
a project.&nbsp; This includes all the source files, include files, libraries, compiler(s), linkers, preprocessors, etc.&nbsp;
that one uses.
<BR><BR>The IDE has a graphical interface that makes it easy to visualize the make-up of a project.&nbsp; A single IDE session
shows a project.&nbsp; If the project consists of a number of components, such as two executables and one library, these are
each shown as target windows in the project window.&nbsp; Each target window shows the files that are needed to construct
the target and is associated via its filename extension with a rule that describes the construction mechanism.&nbsp; For example,
a filename with the extension &quot;.EXE&quot; may be associated with the rule for constructing 32-bit Windows executables,
or a filename with the extension &quot;.LIB&quot; may be associated with the rule for constructing static libraries.&nbsp;
Different projects can refer to the same target.&nbsp; If they do, the target is shared and can be manipulated via either
project, with changes made through one affecting the other.
<BR><BR>The IDE itself is a collection of programs that manages the various files and tools used to create the target libraries
and executables.&nbsp; It creates makefile(s) from the information in the target descriptions and invokes Open Watcom Make
to construct the targets themselves.&nbsp; A configuration file contains built-in knowledge of the Open Watcom compilers,
editors, Profiler, and Browser, as well as all their switches.
<H2 ID="The_Open_Watcom_FORTRAN_77_Tutorial"> The Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 Tutorial </H2>
<BR>This tutorial walks you through the creation and execution of a FORTRAN 77 program under Windows.&nbsp; This will give
you an understanding of the basic concepts of the IDE and its components, and it will detail the steps involved in project
development.&nbsp; The result of this tutorial is a three dimensional drawing of a kitchen which you can manipulate using
either the menus or the icons on the toolbar.&nbsp; You can rotate and resize the drawing, as well as adjust the lighting
and contrast.
<BR><BR>To begin, start the IDE.&nbsp; This is done by double-clicking on the &quot;IDE&quot; icon in the Open Watcom FORTRAN
77 window.
<BR><BR>A status field at the bottom of the IDE window indicates the function of the icon on the toolbar over which your mouse
cursor is currently positioned.&nbsp; If the status area does not show you the function of the icons as you move the mouse
cursor over them, check that no item in the menu bar is highlighted (if one is highlighted, press the Alt key).

<H3 ID="Defining_a_Project"> Defining a Project </H3>
<BR>In this tutorial, you will be creating a new project called<TT> KITCHEN.</TT>&nbsp; Here are the steps required to accomplish
this task.
<OL>
<LI>Define a new project by pulling down the<B> File</B> menu and selecting the<B> New Project...</B>&nbsp; item.&nbsp; You
can also define a new project by clicking on the &quot;Create a new project&quot; icon on the toolbar.
<LI>A choice of different sample project directories is available.&nbsp; Assuming that you installed the Open Watcom FORTRAN
77 software in the<TT> \WATCOM</TT> directory, you will find the sample project directories in the following directory:
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \WATCOM\SAMPLES\IDE\FORTRAN</TT>
<BR><BR>For purposes of this tutorial, we recommend that you select one of the following project directories:
<DL>
<DT>WIN
<DD>for an example of 16-bit Windows 3.x application development when using Windows 3.x under DOS as a host development system,
<DT>WIN386
<DD>for an example of 32-bit Windows 3.x application development when using Windows 3.x under DOS as a host development system,
<DT>WIN32
<DD>for an example of 32-bit Win32 application development when using Windows NT/2000/XP or Windows 95/98/Me as a host development
system, and
<DT>OS2
<DD>for an example of 32-bit OS/2 application development when using 32-bit OS/2 as a host development system.
</DL>
<BR>Thus the<TT> target</TT> that we refer to below should be one of<TT> WIN, WIN386, WIN32,</TT> or<TT> OS2</TT> depending
on your selection.&nbsp; The tutorial uses the<TT> WIN32</TT> example for illustrative purposes.&nbsp; You will find some
minor variations from your selected target environment.
<BR><BR>When asked for a project name, you can do one of two things:
<OL>
<LI>enter the following pathname:
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT>

&quot;/5&quot; option has been added and causes the compiler to generate code that is optimized for the Pentium.&nbsp; In
addition, the &quot;/fp5&quot; option has been added and causes the compiler to generate floating-point code that is optimized
for the Pentium.
<LI>The &quot;/descriptor&quot; option has been added which specifies that string descriptors are to be passed for character
arguments.&nbsp; You can specify the &quot;/nodescriptor&quot; option if you do not want string descriptors to be passed for
character arguments.&nbsp; Instead, the pointer to the actual character data and the length will be passed as two arguments.
&nbsp;The arguments for the length will be passed as additional arguments following the normal argument list.&nbsp; For character
functions, the pointer to the data and the length of the character function will be passed as the first two arguments.
<LI>The &quot;oi&quot; option has been added.&nbsp; This option causes code for statement functions to be generated in-line.
<LI>The floating-point model used when generating in-line 80x87 instructions has changed.&nbsp; If you wish to call subprograms
compiled with version 9.0 you must specify the &quot;/fpr&quot; option.
<LI>Support for records in text files separated by only a line feed character has been added.&nbsp; Previously, records in
text files had to be separated by a carriage return/line feed sequence.
<LI>The &quot;/debug&quot; option has been divided into two separate options.&nbsp; The &quot;/bounds&quot; option generates
array and character subscript checking code.&nbsp; The &quot;/trace&quot; option generates code that allows a run-time traceback
to be generated when a error is issued.
<LI>The &quot;/quiet&quot; option has been added to suppress banner/summary information.&nbsp; The &quot;terminal&quot; option
only affects the display of diagnostic messages (extensions, warnings and errors).&nbsp; For example, compiling with the &quot;/quiet&quot;
option will only display diagnostic messages (if any).
<LI>The &quot;/cc&quot; option has been added.&nbsp; It specifies that unit 6 is a carriage control device and that output
to this unit will be assumed to contain carriage control characters.&nbsp; Note that a blank carriage control character will
automatically be generated for list-directed output.
<LI>The &quot;/automatic&quot; option causes all local variables (including arrays) to be allocated on the stack.&nbsp; Care
should be taken when using this option since the stack requirements of your application may increase dramatically.
<LI>The &quot;/wild&quot; option has been added.&nbsp; It suppresses the compile-time checking that normally causes an error
to be issued when an attempt is made to transfer control into a block structure from outside the block structure and vice
versa.&nbsp; This option is only to be used when compiling existing code that contains GOTO statements of this type; it does
not encourage this style of programming.
<LI>National language support has been added.&nbsp; The &quot;/japanese&quot; option causes the compiler to process Japanese
double-byte characters in variable names and character data.&nbsp; Similarly, the &quot;/chinese&quot; option will process
Traditional Chinese characters and the &quot;/korean&quot; will process Korean characters.
<LI>The &quot;/ob&quot; option has been added.&nbsp; This allows the code generator to use register ESP as a base register
to reference local variables and subprogram arguments.&nbsp; Note that when this option is specified, the compiler will abort
when there is not enough memory to optimize the subprogram.&nbsp; By default, the code generator uses more memory-efficient
algorithms when a low-on-memory condition is detected.
<LI>The GROWHANDLES() function has be added.&nbsp; This function increases the number of files that can be opened by a program
to the specified amount.&nbsp; The value returned is the new maximum.&nbsp; This may be less than the requested amount because
of operating system limitations.
<LI>The IARGC() and IGETARG() functions have been added.&nbsp; IARGC is an integer function that returns the argument count.
&nbsp;IGETARG is an integer function that takes two arguments.&nbsp; The first argument is of type INTEGER and is the index
of the argument to be returned.&nbsp; The second argument is of type CHARACTER and is used to return the argument.&nbsp; The
value returned by the function is the length of the argument.
<LI>The SHARE= specifier has been added to the OPEN statement.&nbsp; It allows the program to specify how other processes
can access a file that is opened by the original process.&nbsp; Possible values for the SHARE= specifier are as follows.
<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DENYRW&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - deny read and write access
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DENYWR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - deny write access
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DENYRD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - deny read access
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DENYNO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - allow read and write access
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPAT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - compatibility mode

<H1 ID="TroubleMShooting"> Trouble-Shooting </H1>
<BR>This section is intended to provide you with help on some of the common (and not so common) problems that users have encountered
when trying to run the software.
<DL>
<DT>Symptom:
<DD>The message &quot;Cannot connect to batch spawn server&quot; is displayed.
<DT>Resolution:
<DD>This message occurs when the Open Watcom IDE is trying to connect to the batch server.&nbsp; The batch server is a program
that is employed by the Open Watcom IDE to run &quot;makes&quot; in the background.&nbsp; There are several reasons why you
may receive this message.
<UL>
<LI><B> Installing Under the Host System and Selecting &quot;Modify System Files&quot; During Install</B>
<BR><BR>For the IDE to run properly under a particular host operating system, the install program must be run on that system.
<BR><BR>It is very important to check the &quot;Modify System Files&quot; when running the install on the host platform.&nbsp;
Otherwise, changes required in the host system's environment will not be made.&nbsp; If this is the problem, you should re-install
under the host environment and select this option.
<LI><B> System stability</B>
<BR><BR>If for some reason the operating system has become unstable, the IDE may have trouble connecting to the batch server.
&nbsp;This can happen if you have run a badly behaved application that caused an exception, for example a page fault.&nbsp;
If this is the problem, you should shutdown the operating system and reboot.
<LI><B> Running Windows 3.1 in Enhanced Mode</B>
<BR><BR>The IDE requires at least version 3.1 of Windows to be running, in enhanced mode.&nbsp; Windows 3.0 is not supported.
</UL>
</DL>
<BR><B>Running Third-Party Shell Programs</B>
<BR><BR>If you run 4DOS.COM or some other shell besides COMMAND.COM, you must change the &quot;BATCHBOX.PIF&quot; file accordingly.
&nbsp;You can do this using the standard Windows PIF editor.
<BR><BR><B>Running Virus Checkers</B>
<BR><BR>If you are running Central Point's PCTOOLS, VWATCH, or some other virus checker, it may be conflicting with our batch
server.&nbsp; To isolate the problem, uninstall the virus checker and see if the IDE works again.
<BR><BR><B>386 Enhanced &quot;Exclusive in Foreground&quot; Option</B>
<BR><BR>If you go to the Windows Control Panel, &quot;Scheduling Options&quot; of &quot;386 Enhanced&quot;, and the &quot;Exclusive
in Foreground&quot; checkbox is checked, uncheck it.&nbsp; This causes our batch server to starve under Windows.
<BR><BR><B>Changes to the SYSTEM.INI File</B>
<BR><BR>The WDEBUG.386 driver is required to be installed in the [386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI.&nbsp; This should have been
done automatically by the WATCOM install program when the software was installed under the host environment and the &quot;modify
system files&quot; option was selected.
<BR><BR>It has been reported that the line
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OverlappedIO=on</TT>
<BR><BR>not appear in the SYSTEM.INI file.
<BR><BR>It appears the user's problem was related to conflicts with other devices installed in the SYSTEM.INI file.&nbsp;
On its own, the above line does not appear to affect the execution of the IDE.
<BR><BR>It has been reported that the line
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NoEMMDriver=ON</TT>
<BR><BR>not appear in the SYSTEM.INI file.&nbsp; It will prevent a link from succeeding in the IDE.
<H2 ID="WinMOSD2_and_OSD2_Specific"> Win-OS/2 and OS/2 Specific </H2>
<BR><B>Installing for a Win-OS/2 Host</B>
<BR><BR>For Win-OS/2, the install must be run under OS/2 and &quot;Modify System Files&quot; must be selected.&nbsp; This
installs the batch server under OS/2, which we require under Win-OS/2.&nbsp; Then the Windows install program should be run
under Win-OS/2 so that the program groups will be created.&nbsp; &quot;Modify System Files&quot; should also be checked for
the Win-OS/2 install.
<BR><BR><B>Named Pipe Conflicts</B>
<BR><BR>Under OS/2, the batch server is a named pipe.&nbsp; Win-OS/2 uses the OS/2 named pipe for the batch server, hence
the OS/2 IDE will conflict with the Win-OS/2 IDE if they are both running.&nbsp; If this is the problem, you should run only
one of the OS/2 and Win-OS/2 IDE, not both at the same time.
